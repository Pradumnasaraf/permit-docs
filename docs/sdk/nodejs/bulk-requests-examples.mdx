# Node.js Bulk Requests Examples

### 1. Bulk Create Relationship Tuples

The bulk request will creates multiple relationship tuples at once using the provided tuple data.       The bulk request is a POST request to the `/relationship_tuples/bulk` endpoint.
        In the data of the request, each tuple object in the operations array is of type RelationshipTupleCreate and is
essentially a tuple of (subject, relation, object, tenant).

- **subject and object** are both resource instances, formatted as `<resource_type:instance_key>` strings (e.g: Folder:budget23).
- **relation** is the name of the relation.
- **tenant** is the key of the tenant in which to place the relation (optional if at least one of subject/object already exists).

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/relationship_tuples/bulk' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
  -D '{ "operations":[
                         {
                         "subject": "organization:permitio",
                         "relation": "owner",
                         "object": "repo:opal",
                         "tenant": "public"
                         },
                     ]
      }'
```
The return value is a list of RelationshipTuple objects, one for each tuple that was created.


### 2. Bulk Delete Relationship Tuples

Deletes multiple relationship tuples at once using the provided tuple data.
The bulk request is a DELETE request to the `/relationship_tuples/bulk` endpoint.
Each tuple object is of type RelationshipTupleDelete and is essentially a tuple of (subject, relation, object).

- **subject and object** are both resource instances, formatted as `<resource_type:instance_key>` strings (e.g: Folder:budget23).
- **relation** is the name of the relation.


```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/relationship_tuples/bulk' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
  -D '{ "idents": [
                    {
                    "subject": "organization:permitio",
                    "relation": "owner",
                    "object": "repo:removed_repo"
                    }
                  ]
      }'
```
### 3. Bulk Create Users

The bulk request creates multiple users at once using the provided user data. The bulk request is a POST request to the `/bulk/users` endpoint. In the data of the request, each user object in the `users` array is of type UserCreate and contains the user's details such as username, email, password, etc.

```bash
curl -X POST \
'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/bulk/users' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  -D '{
            "operations": [{
            "key": "user|892179821739812389327",
            "email": "jane@coolcompany.com",
            "first_name": "Jane",
            "last_name": "Doe",
            "attributes": {}
            }, ...]
        }'
```
### 4. Bulk Replace Users


The bulk request replaces multiple users at once using the provided user data, allowing you to change users' data (e.g., email, first name), except for the `key` value. The bulk request is a PUT request to the `/bulk/users` endpoint. In the data of the request, each user object in the `users` array is of type UserCreate and contains the user's details such as username, email, password, etc.

```bash

curl -X PUT \
'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/bulk/users' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  -D '{
            "operations": [{
            "key": "user|892179821739812389327",
            "email": "jane@coolcompany.com",
            "first_name": "Jane",
            "last_name": "Doe",
            "attributes": {}
            }, ...]
        }'
```


### 5. Bulk Delete Users

The bulk request deletes multiple users at once using the provided user data. The bulk request is a DELETE request to the `/bulk/users` endpoint. In the data of the request, every 'string' value in the `idents` array represents a user to delete.

```bash

curl -X DELETE \
'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/bulk/users' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  -D '{
        "idents": [
                    "user1",
                    "user2"
                  ]
      }'
```


### 6. Possible Errors:
- **PermitApiError**: If the API returns an error HTTP status code.
- **PermitContextError**: If the configured ApiContext does not match the required endpoint context.
