The URL Mapping Permissions Check is a powerful feature that allows you to control access to your application's endpoints based on URLs. This feature supports two approaches:
1. [Simple URL Mapping](#simple-url-mapping) using path parameters with `{var}` syntax
2. [Advanced URL Mapping](#advanced-url-mapping-regex) using regular expressions for complex patterns

Both approaches integrate with the FoAz UI and PDP to provide comprehensive URL-based permissions control.

## Overview

URL Mapping in Permit.io enables you to:
- Map HTTP URLs to specific resources and actions within your application
- Control access based on URL patterns and HTTP methods
- Extract parameters from URLs for use in permission rules
- Implement flexible and maintainable URL-based access control

This feature is available through the FoAz UI & PDP. You can access the FoAz UI inside the Permit App [here](https://app.permit.io/foaz-proxy).

## Simple URL Mapping

Simple URL Mapping uses a straightforward `{var}` syntax to define path parameters in your URLs. This approach is ideal for basic URL patterns where you need to extract simple path parameters.

### Basic Concepts

In FoAz UI, you can set variables as part of the URL using the following syntax: `{var1}`. This feature is called templating the URL, and it's beneficial to reduce the overall number of mapping rules required.

For example, you might set up a URL like this: `example.com/v1/{customer_id}/payments`.

In this case, `{customer_id}` is a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual customer ID during the request. This strategy allows you to use a single mapping rule for all customers, rather than needing a separate rule for each customer.

### Setting Up Simple URL Mapping

The mapping rules feature in the FoAz UI links HTTP URLs to particular resources and actions within the Permit.io platform. These rules are essential for controlling access and permissions on your website or application.

![Mapping Rules Example](/img/foaz/mapping-rules.png)

By correctly setting up mapping rules, you can ensure that requests are correctly routed and that users only have access to the resources that they are authorized to view or modify.

### Checking Permissions

To use the URL Mapping Permissions Check, you must first set up the PDP. You must deploy the following version of the PDP that supports the URL Mapping Check: `pdp-v2:0.2.19-rc.2 or higher`.

Currently, checking permissions using URL Mapping is available through the endpoint `/allowed_url` on the PDP. The SDKs will be updated to support this feature soon.

Here's an example of a payload to `localhost:7766/allowed_url` (assuming you're running the PDP locally):

```json
{
  "user": {
    "key": "raz@permit.io"
  },
  "url": "https://example.com/endpoint?param=value",
  "http_method": "POST",
  "tenant": "default"
}
```

You can see more details about the payload in the Redoc that the PDP hosts here - `http://localhost:7766/redoc#tag/Authorization-API/operation/is_allowed_url_allowed_url_post` - assuming you're running the PDP locally.

## Advanced URL Mapping (Regex)

Advanced URL Mapping uses regular expressions to define complex URL patterns. This approach is particularly useful when you need to:
- Match URLs with complex patterns that can't be easily expressed with simple path parameters
- Extract multiple parameters from both the URL path and query parameters
- Apply the same resource/action mapping to multiple URL patterns that follow a similar structure
- Handle URLs with optional components or complex validation rules

### Regex Pattern Basics

Regex URL mapping uses named capture groups (e.g., `(?P<param_name>pattern)`) to extract values from the URL. These captured values are automatically passed as attributes to your policy, making them available for ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) rules.

### Setting Up Regex URL Mapping

Here's an example of creating a proxy configuration with a regex URL mapping rule:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/proxy_configs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERMIT_KEY' \
--data '{
  "name": "Users API",
  "key": "users_api",
  "mapping_rules": [
    {
      "url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/api/v1/users/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)/profile$",
      "http_method": "post",
      "resource": "users",
      "action": "update",
      "url_type": "regex"
    }
  ],
  "secret":"abc123notUsed"
}'
```

:::danger

Noitce in the API call, the regex pattern is being sent as a JSON string. In JSON, backslashes need to be escaped themselves, so `\.` becomes `\\.` in the JSON payload.

:::

Key points about this configuration:
- The `url_type` must be set to `"regex"` to enable regex pattern matching
- The regex pattern uses named capture groups (`?P<name>pattern`) to extract values
- The pattern matches URLs that contain a numeric user ID in the path
- The extracted user_id value will be available as an attribute in your policy

:::note 
The `secret` value is still required for now, even though it isn't used. This will be fixed in a future relase of the proxy_configs API.

### Checking Permissions

To use the Advanced URL Mapping Permissions Check, you must first set up the PDP. You must deploy the following version of the PDP that supports the URL Mapping Check: `permitio/pdp-v2:0.8.0-rc.1 or higher`.

Currently, checking permissions using URL Mapping is available through the endpoint `/allowed_url` on the PDP. The SDKs will be updated to support this feature soon.

Here's an example of a payload to `localhost:7766/allowed_url` (assuming you're running the PDP locally):

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:7766/allowed_url' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer permit_key_{your_key}' \
--data '{
  "user": {
    "key": "raz@permit.io"
  },
  "url": "https://api.example.com/users/123/profile",
  "http_method": "post",
  "tenant": "default"
}'

```

### Common Regex Patterns

<TimelineWrapper>
<TimelineStep>


#### Basic Path Parameter
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/users/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)/profile$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with a numeric user ID in the path. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/users/123/profile`

`https://api.example.com/users/456/profile`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/users/` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `/profile` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is perfect for RESTful APIs where you need to extract a numeric ID from a fixed URL structure.

</TimelineStep>

<TimelineStep>


#### Optional Path Component
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/api/users(?:/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+))?$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with an optional user ID. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/api/users`

`https://api.example.com/api/users/123`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/api/users` | Matches the literal path segments |
| `(?:...)` | Non-capturing group (used for grouping without capturing) |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `?` | Makes the entire group optional |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is useful when you have endpoints that can work both with and without an ID, like a list endpoint vs. a detail endpoint.

</TimelineStep>

<TimelineStep>


#### Multiple Query Parameters
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/search\\?(?=.*q=(?P<query>[^&]+))(?=.*page=(?P<page>[0-9]+)).*$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with specific query parameters in any order. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/search?q=test&page=1`

`https://api.example.com/search?page=2&q=example`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/search` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `\?` | Matches the literal question mark (escaped) |
| `(?=...)` | Positive lookahead (ensures something exists without consuming it) |
| `.*` | Matches any characters |
| `[^&]+` | Matches one or more characters that aren't ampersands (for query values) |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is ideal for search endpoints where parameters can appear in any order.

</TimelineStep>

#### Subdomain Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://[\\w-]+\\.example\\.com/api/v1/users/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with any subdomain. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/api/v1/users/123`

`https://staging.example.com/api/v1/users/456`

`https://dev-api.example.com/api/v1/users/789`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `[\w-]+` | Matches one or more word characters or hyphens:<br/>- `\w`: matches letters, numbers, and underscores<br/>- `-`: allows hyphens in subdomains |
| `\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/api/v1/users/` | Matches the literal path segments |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is perfect for environments like staging, dev, or production APIs.

#### Flexible User Path Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https?:\\/\\/[^\\/]+(?:.*?\\/users(?:\\/(?P<user_id>[^\\/]+))?(?:\\/.*)?)?$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern is useful for matching any URL that contains a user ID, regardless of the exact path structure. It will match URLs like:

`https://api.example.com/users/123`

`https://api.example.com/v1/users/123`

`https://api.example.com/v1/users/123/profile`

`https://api.example.com/v1/users/123/settings/notifications`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https?` | Matches "http" or "https" (the 's' is optional) |
| `:\/\/` | Matches the literal "://" (forward slashes are escaped) |
| `[^\/]+` | Matches the domain (any characters except forward slashes) |
| `.*?` | Non-greedy match of any characters |
| `(?:\/.*)?` | Optional trailing path segments |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is extremely flexible, matching any URL structure that contains a user ID, making it useful for complex API structures.

</TimelineStep>

<TimelineStep>


#### Protocol-Agnostic Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https?:\\/\\/api\\.example\\.com\\/users\\/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)\\/profile$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match both HTTP and HTTPS URLs. It will match:

`http://api.example.com/users/123/profile`

`https://api.example.com/users/123/profile`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https?` | Matches "http" or "https" (the 's' is optional) |
| `:\/\/` | Matches the literal "://" (forward slashes are escaped) |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped) |
| `/users/` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `/profile` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is useful when your API needs to support both secure and non-secure connections, or during development when testing with different protocols.

</TimelineStep>

<TimelineStep>


#### Domain-Agnostic Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https:\\/\\/[^\\/]+\\/api\\/v1\\/users\\/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)\\/profile$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match any domain name. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/api/v1/users/123/profile`

`https://api.staging.example.com/api/v1/users/123/profile`

`https://api.production.example.com/api/v1/users/123/profile`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https:\/\/` | Matches the literal "https://" (forward slashes are escaped) |
| `[^\/]+` | Matches the domain (any characters except forward slashes) |
| `/api/v1/` | Matches the literal API version path |
| `/users/` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `/profile` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is ideal for microservices architectures where the same API might be deployed across different domains or environments, allowing you to reuse the same permission rules regardless of the domain.

### Best Practices

1. **Escape Special Characters**: Always escape special characters in your regex patterns (e.g., `\.` for dots in domains).
2. **Use Anchors**: Start patterns with `^` and end with `$` to ensure complete URL matching.
3. **Named Groups**: Always use named capture groups for parameters you want to extract.
4. **Test Patterns**: Test your regex patterns thoroughly before deploying to production.
5. **Keep Patterns Simple**: While regex is powerful, try to keep patterns as simple as possible for better maintainability.
