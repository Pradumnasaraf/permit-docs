## **Authentication & Authorization—Better Together**  
Authentication (AuthN) is the foundation of secure access control, ensuring that users are who they claim to be. But authentication alone isn't enough—you also need fine-grained authorization (AuthZ) to control what they can do. Permit.io seamlessly integrates with authentication providers to bring policy-driven access control to your applications.  

**Secure authentication meets fine-grained authorization with Permit.io.**

## **What is Authentication & Why It Matters**  
Authentication (AuthN) is the process of verifying user identity, typically through credentials such as usernames and passwords, Single Sign-On (SSO), or multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

Authorization (AuthZ), on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user can do within an application. While authentication is about identity, authorization is about access control.

A secure system requires both authentication and authorization working together to protect sensitive resources and ensure users only access what they are allowed to.

## **Integrating AuthN with Permit.io**

AuthN establishes user identity, but for a system to function securely and efficiently, there must be a **handoff** to AuthZ. Permit.io facilitates this transition by ensuring that the authorization system has the most up-to-date user and role information at all times.

To achieve this, there are multiple ways to sync user data between AuthN and AuthZ:

- **Live & In-Line Sync:**
  - After authentication, call `syncUser()` to update Permit.io with the latest user attributes and roles.
  - Alternatively, pass the JWT payload as attributes in `permit.check()` to dynamically include user details in access decisions.

- **Pre-Sync (Backend Sync):**
  - Use Permit.io's API to pre-sync user data before authorization checks occur.
  - Automate user and role provisioning with SCIM to keep authorization aligned with identity provider updates.

Permit.io recommends using `syncUser()` immediately after AuthN for most architectures. However, depending on how roles are assigned and managed, other strategies may be more appropriate. Whether you use a live sync approach, backend synchronization, or a combination of both, Permit.io ensures your AuthZ policies remain accurate and up-to-date.

When it comes to AuthN, Permit.io provides the flexability to:
- Connect to any existing authentication provider utilizing the concept of "the handoff point"
- Synchronize users and roles via SCIM or API

## **Supported AuthN Providers**
Permit.io works with various authentication solutions, making it easy to integrate with your existing infrastructure.

**Identity Providers (IdPs) Supported:**  
- Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Google, AWS Cognito, and more  

**Authentication Standards:**  
- OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), SAML, WS-Fed, Headers, mTLS, and others

**Custom Authentication:**  
- Bring your own authentication and sync users with Permit.io via API

## **Choosing the Right Approach for AuthN-Managed Roles**  
Authentication verifies identity, but **where should roles and policies be managed?**

Permit.io offers multiple approaches to role management, each with its own benefits depending on your needs.

### **Approach 1: AuthN-Managed Roles (IdP-Managed)**  
- **Best For:** Centralized enterprise access, SCIM-based role provisioning  
- **How It Works:** Roles are assigned in an identity provider (IdP) and synced with Permit.io for enforcement.  
- **Pros:** Simplifies role assignment with centralized IT management.  
- **Cons:** Limited flexibility for dynamic permissions, no support for ReBAC.  

### **Approach 2: Application-Managed Roles (Permit.io-Managed)**  
- **Best For:** Multi-tenant SaaS apps, dynamic access control
- **How It Works:** Roles are created and managed within Permit.io, allowing for granular, flexible access control.  
- **Pros:** Supports dynamic and contextual access control, ReBAC, and custom role management.  
- **Cons:** Requires user sync and structured role assignment.  

### **Approach 3: Hybrid AuthN & Permit.io Role Management**  
- **Best For:** Organizations that need both centralized role management and flexible application-level access control.
- **How It Works:** IT manages high-level roles in the IdP, while Permit.io refines access with fine-grained policies.  
- **Pros:** Combines IT governance with application-specific control.  
- **Cons:** Requires clear role handoff mechanisms between IT and application owners.

## **How AuthN & Permit.io Work Together**  
1. **User Logs In** → Identity Provider (IdP) or authentication system authenticates the user.
2. **Permit.io Syncs User Info** → Users & roles are synced via `syncUser()` to keep AuthZ policy data up-to-date.
3. **Permit.io Applies Policy Enforcement** → Decisions are based on roles, attributes, and relationships.
4. **Access is Granted or Denied** → Enforcement happens via a Permit.io SDK, API Gateways AuthZ integration, or direct PDP API call.

## **TL;DR**
- **AuthN establishes identity, AuthZ defines access.**
- **Permit.io seamlessly integrates with any AuthN provider to enforce granular access control.**
- **Choose the right role management approach: AuthN-managed, Permit.io-managed, or hybrid.**
- **Use `syncUser()` post-authN to ensure real-time updates.**
- **Supports SCIM, API-based sync, JWT attribute passing, and direct policy enforcement.**

## **Why This Works:**  
- **Clearly separates AuthN vs. AuthZ responsibilities.**  
- **Helps teams choose the best role management approach for their needs.**  
- **Provides an overview while linking to deeper, technical content.**  
- **Ensures alignment with SCIM-based provisioning, API-based sync, and dynamic role assignment.**
