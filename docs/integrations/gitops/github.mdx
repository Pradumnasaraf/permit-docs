Learn how to manage the policies configured in Permit in your GitHub repositories using GitOps

---


To configure your GitHub repository to work properly with Permit, this guide will walk you through two main steps:
1. Add an SSH deploy key with write access to your repository.
2. Configure Permit to use your repository with the SSH url and the deploy key.

:::tip
While this guide is focused on GitHub, the same steps can be applied to other Git providers that supports SSH deploy keys with minor modifications.

- [Add deploy key to GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/)
- [Add deploy key to Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/)
:::


## Add SSH Deploy Key

The following steps will guide you on GitHub in order to add an SSH deploy key with write access to your repository.

### Create a repository

You need a repository with a default branch that exists on the remote ( with an initial commit ).
If you already have a repository you can skip to [next step](#generate-an-ssh-key).

Create your repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/new):

:::info 
When utilizing Permit GitOps and [Copy Environment API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Environments/operation/copy_environment) with a
brand-new Git repository that has **no commits on the main branch**, ensure that at least one file is added and committed. This step
is essential for our system to successfully clone the branch.
:::

By default the following mapping takes effect - each repository is mapped to a specific Permit project, and under it branches are created and mapped for each Permit environment under the Project.
Additional layout are supported, but not currently available via the API.

### Generate an SSH key

In order for us to be able to generate and push policies to your repository, you need to create an SSH key,
and add it as a "Deploy Key" with write access to your repo.

You can use this command to generate a secured SSH key:

```
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -C "help@permit.io"
```

You will be prompted to enter a location for the private and public keys ( your private key will be securely stored on our end, no passphrase will be required )
![SSH key generation](/img/integrations/gitops/generate-ssh-key.png)

The private key is at the location you chose and the public key is at the same location with a ".pub" suffix.

### Add the Deploy Key

:::info Note
Ensure that this deploy key is configured without Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to allow the Permit server unimpeded read and
write access to your repository.
:::

1. To add a "Deploy Key", go to your repository &rarr; Settings &rarr; Deploy Keys and press on "Add deploy key" button.

2. Copy the public SSH key you've generated [previously](#generate-an-ssh-key) to your clipboard and paste it in the GitHub prompt.

   **It is required to toggle the "Allow write access"**

## Permit GitOps Configuration
The following steps will guide you on how to configure Permit to use your GitHub repository with the SSH url and the deploy key.

### Create a JSON Configuration File
To perform the initial GitOps configuration API call to Permit, you need to create a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
   {
     "url": "<your-ssh-url>",
     "main_branch_name": "<your-default-branch>",
     "credentials": {
       "auth_type": "ssh",
       "username": "git",
       "private_key": "<your-private-key>"
     },
     "key": "<your-custom-id-string-without-spaces>"
   }
```

With this JSON created, we can start filling it in with the required information.

### Copy the SSH Details from GitHub
1. Copy the SSH url from GitHub, and replace the `<your-ssh-url>` placeholder in the JSON file
   ![Copy SSH url](/img/integrations/gitops/github-copy-ssh-url.png)

2. Copy the SSH private key you've generated [previously](#generate-an-ssh-key) and replace new lines with "\n".
   You can do the new line replacement using the following command:

   ```shell
   awk -v ORS='\\n' '1' <private-key-file>
   ```

3. Replace the `<your-default-branch>` placeholder with the default branch name of your repository (usually `main`).

### Get your Project Key / ID from Permit

1. Login to [Permit.io](https://app.permit.io).

2. Navigate to your project. with the project selector at sidebar.

3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://app.permit.io/settings/api-keys) page and create a project or organization API key.

    ![API Keys Page](/img/integrations/gitops/permit-settings-api-keys.png)

4. Get your project key / id from this URL

   ```shell
   curl -X GET "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY from step 3}"
   ```
5. Replace the JSON placeholder with your [project id or key](/api/examples/get-project-and-env/#get-project-id-or-key)

### Configure Permit to Use Your Repository

1. Execute a POST request to Permit with your json:

   ```shell
   curl -X POST "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/<your-project-id-or-key>/repos" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY from step 4}" --data-binary @"path/to/your/json"
   ```

2. Now, if you'll return to your GitHub repository. You will now observe new branches, each corresponding to a different environment in your project. These branches are named following the format `permit/generated/<env_id>`, where `<env_id>` is the unique identifier for each environment.
You can specify a custom branch name by setting the `custom_branch_name` of your environment, [see an example](/api/examples/manage-env#customize-gitops-branch-name).

3. After validating your new policy branches, you need to activate the new repository in Permit,
    to do this, replace the below placeholders with your [project id or key](/api/examples/get-project-and-env/#get-project-id-or-key) and execute a PUT request to Permit:
    ```shell
    curl -X PUT "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/<your-project-id-or-key>/repos/<your-repo-id-or-key>/activate" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-permit-api-key>"
    ```

### Test Your Configuration
Now that we activated our Git repository to work with Permit, let's test out a custom policy in it.
1. Check out the correct branch using `permit/generated/<env_id>`.

2. Insert your policy code exclusively within the `custom` folder. This can be done by either editing the `custom/root.rego` file with your custom Rego code or by creating a new file and importing it in the `custom/root.rego` file. You can see an example of such custom policy [here](/integrations/gitops/custom_policy)

   :::warning Important Note
   Please avoid editing policy code outside of this folder, as it could potentially be overridden by our code or break the Rego code.
   :::

3. Once modifications are made within an environment branch, push it to the remote GitHub repository(To the same environment branch not the main branch). Permit cloud will then detect these changes and relay them to the PDP that is associated with that environment for update.

Your git repository is now ready to be synced to your PDPs, test it by checking permissions against your newly created custom policies ðŸš€
