### Connecting SCIM with Permit.io

This guide will walk you through integrating SCIM with Permit.io using Entra ID (Formerly Azure Active Directory). SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) allows you to manage user identities seamlessly across systems.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Permit API Key ([How to get Permit API Key](/overview/connecting-your-app#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key))
- Permit's project ID and environment ID ([How to find Permit's project ID and environment ID](/manage-your-account/projects-and-env#getting-the-environment-id))
- Entra ID account

### Configuring Entra ID with SCIM
1. Log in to your Entra ID account.
2. Click on the `Enterprise applications` tab under the `Applications` section.

9. Click on the `Test Connection` button to verify the connection, then click on the `Save` button.

### Testing the SCIM Integration
You can now test the SCIM integration by creating a new user in Entra ID and verifying if the user is created in Permit.io.
1. Create a new user in Entra ID and assign it to the application you created - following step 6 from before.
2. After clicking on the `Provisioning` tab, go to `Provision on demand`.
3. There, you can provision the user to Permit.io by searching the user and clicking on the `Provision` button.
