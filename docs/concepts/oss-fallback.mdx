## Permit OSS as fallback

While Permit is not an [open-core](https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-open-source-or-why-open-core-is-dead/) company, many of its underlying components are OSS based.
These allow for easier fallback option in migrating from Permit, reducing vendor lock-in , and tech stack mixins.
Yes, you are reading right - we are actually explaining how to move away from Permit, if you choose to - we do hope you choose to stay with us of course-- but we want you to have all the choices.

## Permit OSS foundations

The following is a list of key OSS items in Permit

- [OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal) is a key component in Permit's control-plane - it is what allows Permit to manage PDPs at scale with a zero-trust, real-time, event driven fashion.
- [OPA](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) is a first class citizen decision-engine option powering Permit's PDPs
- [Cedar-agent](https://github.com/permitio/cedar-agent) is a first class citizen decision-engine option powering Permit's PDPs
- The Permit SDKs - SDKs per language enabling API usage and wrapping calls from code to the policy-engines

## Fallback Concept Guide

To migrate from Permit to a self made standalone solution one can follow the following steps:

1. Use Permit's Gitops feature to sync all of the policies generated by Permit's policy-editor backend into a git repository - you now have code ready to run on your policy engine of choice which you can freely edit.
2. Setup your own control plane based on OPAL to act as a replacement to Permit's control plane
3. Setup PDP container images with OPAL-client and your policy-engine of choice
4. Create your own SDK, or use Permit's SDKs in a passthrough mode - talking directly to the policy engines within the PDPs
5. (Extra) Build back-office / customer facing interfaces you need to consume on-top, as API or UI - to provide management
