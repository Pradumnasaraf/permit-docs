---

This checklist highlights Permit’s **unique advantages** over homebrewed and alternative solutions, showcasing why it stands out in the authorization and access control space.

## Dynamic Policy Updates

Permit enables fully event-driven dynamic policy updates via our open-source project [OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal). This ensures that policy changes are propagated in real-time across distributed environments without requiring application restarts or manual interventions.

## Policy Builder (Wizard/UI)

Permit’s **visual Policy Builder** simplifies complex authorization rules with an intuitive UI. It supports:

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** – Assign permissions based on user roles.
- **ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control)** – Define permissions based on user relationships.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** – Fine-grained control based on user, resource, and environment attributes.

## Fully API-Driven Admin Access

Permit is designed with an **Admin API-first** approach, meaning everything can be programmatically controlled via RESTful APIs, making it easy to integrate and automate authorization workflows.

## Stateful or Stateless Flexibility

You can choose how to load and manage authorization data:

- **Stateless Mode** – Dynamically load data as part of an input query for real-time checks.
- **Stateful Mode** – Maintain state within Permit by syncing data from multiple sources, ensuring authorization decisions are made with preloaded context.

## Data Plane Segregation from Control Plane

Permit provides a strict separation between the **Control Plane** (where policies are managed) and the **Data Plane** (where authorization decisions are enforced). This architecture improves security, scalability, and compliance.

## Custom Data Modelling & Schema

Permit allows organizations to define and structure their own authorization data models.

- **Support for hierarchical and custom attributes**.
- **Seamless integration with identity providers and databases**.

## Unmatched Data Consistency & Low Latency

Permit’s hybrid architecture provides multiple consistency guarantees:

- **Zero Latency**: Local PDPs (Policy Decision Points) execute decisions instantly at the edge (<10ms on p95).
- **Hybrid Model**: Provides centralized policy management while maintaining local enforcement.
- **Fine-Tuned Consistency Options**:
  - **Eventual consistency** (PDP updates within ~100ms on P95)
  - **Fully consistent updates** for mission-critical policies
  - **Health-check-based consistency with callbacks** for dynamic environments

## Support for Multiple Authorization Models

Permit provides out-of-the-box support for:

- **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control)
- **ReBAC** (Relationship-Based Access Control)
- **ABAC** (Attribute-Based Access Control)
- **PBAC** (Policy-Based Access Control), enabling highly configurable policies using Rego, Cedar, Terraform, and other languages

## Powerful Authorization Queries Beyond YES/NO

Permit goes beyond simple authorization checks:

- **Basic Enforcement**: [Check authorization decisions](/how-to/enforce-permissions/check)
- **Feature Flagging**: [Enable conditional access with CASL](/integrations/feature-flagging/casl)
- **Resource Visibility**: [List all resources a user can access](/how-to/enforce-permissions/user-permissions)
- **Action-Specific Checks**: [Determine all actions a user can perform on a resource](/how-to/enforce-permissions/bulk-check)
- **Filtering & Fine-Grained Access Control**: [Identify deletable resources](/how-to/enforce-permissions/data-filtering)

## Open Source & Licensing

Permit embraces **open-source principles**, allowing full transparency and flexibility:

- All customer-deployed components (**PDP, SDKs, OPAL**) are **open-source** under Apache licenses.
- Organizations can self-host components while maintaining full control over their authorization logic.

## Comprehensive Audit & Compliance

Permit offers industry-leading compliance and security features:

- **Three Types of Audit Logs**:
  - Application audit logs (for tracking app authorization events)
  - Permit audit logs (for tracking internal authorization system changes)
  - API logs (for tracking API-based authorization events)
- **Decision Logs** for full transparency in access control decisions
- **Authorization for Authorization (AuthZ for AuthZ)** to control policy changes
- **SOC 2 Type II & HIPAA compliance** for enterprise security and data privacy

## Telemetry & Observability

Permit provides extensive observability features for monitoring and debugging:

- **Supports OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing
- **Structured Logging** for deep analytics
- **Datadog Integration** for seamless application monitoring

## Backup & Versioning

Permit ensures robust backup and disaster recovery mechanisms:

- **Git-backed policies** for version control and policy auditing
- **Backup & point-in-time restore** to recover previous authorization states
- **Persisted PDP states** to ensure fault-tolerant deployments
