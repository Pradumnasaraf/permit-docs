## Overview

The API now allows us to create **[Embeddable Element](/embeddable-uis/embedding-elements)** calls, which give much more flexibility when defining them.

To get a list of all the elements, you can use the following API call:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/elements/<project_id>/<env_id>/config' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <API secret key>' \
  -H 'origin: https://app.permit.io' \
```

There you can find the list of all the elements that are available to you. You can then use the `element_id` to use in the other API calls.
