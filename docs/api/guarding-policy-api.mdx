Policy guard is applied at the organization level to create rules for your policies. These rules specify what actions are allowed or denied for each project, helping manage permissions across different projects.

## Key Features

- **Manage Policy Guard Scopes:** Create, update, delete, and associate policy guard scopes.
- **Rule Management:** Add or remove permissions (rules) for each policy guard scope.
- **Flexible Scoping:** Manage multiple projects with the scope applied at the organizational level.
