The guarding policy API allows you to manage policy on your organization's policy.
Guarding policy is applied at the organization level, and you can include specific projects to be governed by that policy,
ensuring centralized control over how permissions and roles are managed across those projects.



## API Endpoints

for adding new project to the guarding policy, you can use the following endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/guarding_policy/{id}/project/{project}' \
  -H 'authorization
```

for adding new action on role to the guarding policy, you can use the following endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/guarding_policy/{id}/actions' \
  -H 'authorization
  --data-raw '{"action":"create","role":"admin","resource":"document", "value":true}'
```
