The Groups API allows you to manage your objects within a group. You can create, update, delete, and list groups.
It also enables you to manage ReBAC permissions for a group of users.
You can assign roles to a group and then add users to the group through the Groups API.
The roles assigned to the group will derive to the users within the group.

Check the [Groups Redoc ](/) for more information.


## Example Usage

We have a group called 'permit', that will be represented with resource 'permit', resource instance 'employees', and role 'member'.
Adittionly, we will have another resource 'marketing' with resource instance 'social_media' and role 'editor'.
Once we set the role 'editor' for the 'permit group', this is the process that will happen in the API:
- create role derivation from 'permit#member' to 'marketing#editor'
- create a relation between 'permit' and 'marketing' with a relation between 'group_permit'
- create relationship between 'permit#employees' and 'marketing#social_media'.

Then we will have group 'permit' and every user who is a 'member' in this group will have the role 'editor' in the resource 'marketing#social_media'.
