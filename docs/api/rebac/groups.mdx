The Groups API allows you to manage your resources and users within groups. You can create, update, delete, and list groups.
Groups enable you to easily group together resources, resource-instances, and users. In addition groups simplify ReBAC permissions for users, by allowing roles to be assigned to the groups themselves.
You can assign roles to a group and then add users to the group through the Groups API.
The users within the group will derive roles form the roles assigned to the group .

Check the [Groups Redoc ](/) for more information.


## Example Usage for User Groups

### Assign roles to a group:

Let's say we want to represent a company and its employees as a group, and then assign all the employees access to a shared marketing resource (social-media) via the group.  We'll have a group named 'company' (Which is represented as a resource named 'company'), and an instance of a specific company 'Acme'.  Users are assigned to `Acme` via a role called `member`
Additionally, we will have a resource-instance of type 'marketing' - 'social_media' which supports the role 'editor'.
Once we assign the role 'editor' to  the `company` group, the following will by automated by API:
- create role derivation from 'company#member' to 'marketing#editor'
- create a relation between 'company' and 'marketing' with a relation between 'company_group'
- create relationship between 'company#Acme' and 'marketing#social_media'.

Then we will have group 'company' and every user who is a 'member' in this group will have the role 'editor' in the resource 'marketing#social_media'.

### Assign users to a group:

When you assign "user-1" to 'company' group, the following will by automated by API:
- assign 'user-1' to 'company#member' role

and the user will also get the role 'marketing#editor' in the resource 'marketing#social_media'.


## Create a Group via API

To create a new group, make a POST request to the following with the required data:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
  --data-raw '{"group_instance_key": "Acme"}' \
```

To add a new role to group, make a POST request to the following with the required data:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/group/{group_resource_type_key}/roles' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
  --data-raw '{"resource": "marketing", "resource_instance": "social_media", "role": "editor", tenant:"business"}' \
```

To add users to a group, make a PUT request to the following with the required data:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups/{group_resource_type_key}/users/{user_id}' \
    -H 'authorization
      --data-raw '{"tenant":"business"}' \
    ```
