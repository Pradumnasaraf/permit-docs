The Groups API allows you to manage your objects within a group. You can create, update, delete, and list groups.
Groups enable you to gather resource, resource instances and also allow you to manage ReBAC permissions for a group of users, and have associated roles.
You can assign roles to a group and then add users to the group through the Groups API.
The roles assigned to the group will derive to the users within the group.

Check the [Groups Redoc ](/) for more information.


## Example Usage for User Groups

We have a group called 'company_1', that will be represented with resource 'company_1', resource instance 'employees', and role 'member'.
Adittionly, we will have another resource 'marketing' with resource instance 'social_media' and role 'editor'.
Once we set the role 'editor' for the company_1 group, this is the process that will happen in the API:
- create role derivation from 'company_1#member' to 'marketing#editor'
- create a relation between 'company_1' and 'marketing' with a relation between 'group_company_1'
- create relationship between 'company_1#employees' and 'marketing#social_media'.

Then we will have group 'company_1' and every user who is a 'member' in this group will have the role 'editor' in the resource 'marketing#social_media'.
