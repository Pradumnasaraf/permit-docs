In this section, we will cover some common issues that you might encounter while embedding Permit Elements in your application.


## Permit Element Login issues
In order to use Permit Elements, you must use the `permit.elements.login()` method in your frontend application with one of the supported login methods.
Read more about the supported login methods [here].

:::tip
In most cases, we recommend using **"Developer Tools" -> "Network"** (tab) in your browser to debug the requests and responses of the login method.

### Error `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` -
![ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED](/img/elements/troubleshooting/err-connection-refused.png)

If you are seeing this error when running the login method from the frontend app, it means that the server you are using for the login-in is not running.

Make sure that the server is running and accessible from the frontend application.
### CORS issues -
![CORS issues](/img/elements/troubleshooting/cors.png)

If you are seeing CORS issues, it means that the server you are using for the login-in is not configured to allow requests from the frontend application.
Make sure that the server is configured to allow requests from the frontend application.

Here is an example of how to configure CORS in Express.js:
```javascript
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:3001"); // update to match the domain you will make the request from
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, X-Permit-User-Key");
    next();
});
```

### Error `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` -
![ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE](/img/elements/troubleshooting/empty-response.png)
This error usually occurs when the server is not sending any response back to the frontend application.
That could be due to a server error or a network issue - check the server logs for more information.

### General Login Errors -
![General Errors](/img/elements/troubleshooting/embed-error.png)
You might see a `embed_error.html` page in the **"Developer Tools" -> "Network" tab** with a general error message if there is an issue with the login method.

In most cases, the error message will give you a hint about what is wrong - for more information, check the [Login Errors] section in Login Methods page.
