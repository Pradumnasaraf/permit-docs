The Login Method for Permit Elements is a simple and secure way to embed Permit Elements into your application.

### Server-side Login method

In the server side, We have the `loginAs` function takes two parameters.
You need to pass in the unique `userId` you get from your **JWT** (JSON Web Token),and a `tenant_key` or `tenantId`.
Passing in the tenant is **compulsory** when logging in a user **server-side**.

```js
permit.elements.loginAs({ userId, tenant });
```
:::info IMPORTANT
The **user must belong to the tenant** that he will be logged into. If he is not, you will see a login error saying `USER_NOT_FOUND`.

If the user gets logged out, he also exits the current tenant specificed in the `loginAs` method. If you want to **change tenants** for
a user, you need to **log them out**, and **log them back in** to a different tenant.

### Initializing Permit

<CodeDropdown
    number="1"
    title=""
    server
    code={[code.initialize_node, code.initialize_python, code.initialize_dotnet, code.initialize_java]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
>
    {/* If you are already using Permit, you can skip this step. */}
    In order to use Permit Elements, you need to be a **user of Permit**. When starting to use Permit, you will need to
    initialize an instance of Permit in your backend logic. This **only needs to be done once**, both to use Permit and
    Elements.
    Please remember to copy your `SDK Secret Key` and pass it into the initialized Permit object.

</CodeDropdown>


You need to create a route in your backend server to allow your client to `loginAs` themselves and get access the Permit Element.

The backend `loginAs` route is matched based on the Authentication methods you have implemented inside your App. Most applications
authenticate with the **Bearer Token** or **Cookies**, but we also allows you to use any other **HTTP Security Header**. The important
part here is, that you use the appropriate code example below based on your Authentication method.

<CodeDropdown

  title="Using Cookies"

  code={[code.cookies_node, code.cookies_python, code.cookies_dotnet, code.cookies_java]}
  language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
  languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
></CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
  number="2.2"
  title="Using Bearer Token"

  code={[code.bearer_node, code.bearer_python, code.bearer_dotnet, code.bearer_java]}

></CodeDropdown>

  language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}

  If you use custom Authentication Header to authenticate to your backend, add this route to your
  backend.

### Install Permit-js

Once you have your application ready, you need to install Permits's JS SDK. This gives you access to our prebuilt embeddable Element components.

Run the following command to install the Permit-js SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install @permitio/permit-js
```


### Client-side login method

In the client side, you need to call the `login` function to log in the user. This function is used to log in the user to the Permit Element
and get access to the Element.

This is the permit element object that is calling the backend route we have
configured previously and logging in the user.

```js
permit.elements.login({
    loginUrl: 'https://your_app_url.com/login_cookie,
        tenant: 'your_tenant_key',
        token:'<TOKEN>',
        loginMethod: LoginMethod.bearer
        }).then((res: any) => {//optional handle success
        }).catch((err: any) => {//handle error
        });",
```

There are few things that need to be configured here:

1.  `loginUrl` - The url that corresponds to your backend login route you created in the last step.
2.  `loginMethod` - The login method you are using in your backend.
3.  `tenant` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method. the name of the tenant that the user is part of, you can set it at your backend as well, if you are using frontendOnly this is required.
4.  `token` (Optional) - Required for bearer token login method, you need to pass the token here.
5.  `headers` (Optional) - Required for custom headers login method, you need to pass the headers here.
6.  `userJwt` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the user jwt here.
7.  `envId` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the env id here.


This function should be called as early as possible in your App. This is best done inside a `App`/`index` file; **right after** the users
had just had their identity confirmed by the Authorization provider you are using, but **just before** the Embedded component is loaded.

With any of these login frontend methods, it's **optional** to pass in your **tenant key**, in comparison to the server-side call where **it
is required**. The server-side tenant will **always take precedence**. We do however encourage passing in the same tenant in your frontend
and backend login calls for best practices and for adding clarity to your code.

##### How to use the `login` function

There are **4 supported login options** choose the one that you are using in your backend.

<CodeDropdown
  number="4.1"
  title="Cookie Login Method"
  client
  code={[code.loginDefault]}
  language={["javascript"]}
  languages={["JS"]}
  open={false}
>
  The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.cookie`.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
  number="4.2"
  title="Bearer Token Login Method"
  client
  code={[code.loginHeaders]}
  language={["javascript"]}
  languages={["JS"]}
  open={false}
>
  The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.bearer` and the **token**
  should be set to the current user token.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
	number="4.3"
	title="Other Header Login Method"
	client
	code={[code.other_headers]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["JS"]}
	open={false}
>
	The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.header`
	and you should pass the **headers** to the current user auth headers.
</CodeDropdown>
<CodeDropdown
	number="4.4"
	title="FrontendOnly"
	client
	code={[
		code.frontendOnlyLogin
	]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["JS"]}
>
  For FrontendOnly Login, please check our [Embedded Elements](/embeddable-uis/overview) documentation.
</CodeDropdown>

After you run login successfully you will **get a cookie** called `permit_session` which will allow you to
load your Permit Element securely and successfully.

### Client-side logout method

This function should be called along with the logging-out logic that you have within your App, to make sure the user does not
continue to have access to the Permit Element.

This logout method **should be called** as part of the logic of logging your user out with your
authentication solution.

```javascript
permit.elements.logout();
```

### Login Errors

There are a few possible errors you might find yourself come across while working with the embedding of Permit Elements.

| Error                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USER_NOT_FOUND`           | This error can appear if you are trying to log in as a particular user, but that **user does not exist within Permit**. You can also experience this login error when you are trying to login a user into a **tenant that he does not belong to**. |
| `TENANT_NOT_FOUND`         | This error can appear when you are passing in a tenant, either in the frontend `permit.elements.login` function, or in your backend URL endpoint, where the tenant has not been created in Permit.                                                 |
| `INVALID_PERMISSION_LEVEL` | This error will emerge when you are trying to access part of the Element which you have not been given access too. This usually means the role that the person obtained has remained in the **Hidden Roles** permission level.                     |
| `FORBIDDEN_ACCESS`         | This error will emerge when you are trying to login to an Element you have not been given permission to see.                                                                                                                                       |
