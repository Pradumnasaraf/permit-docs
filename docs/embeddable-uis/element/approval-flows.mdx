### Initializing Permit

<CodeDropdown
    number="1"
    title=""
    server
    code={[code.initialize_node, code.initialize_python, code.initialize_dotnet, code.initialize_java]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
    open
>
    {/* If you are already using Permit, you can skip this step. */}
    In order to use Permit Elements, you need to be a **user of Permit**. When starting to use Permit, you will need to
    initialize an instance of Permit in your backend logic. This **only needs to be done once**, both to use Permit and
    Elements.
    Please remember to copy your `SDK Secret Key` and pass it into the initialized Permit object.

</CodeDropdown>

### Server-side Login Route

You need to create a route in your backend server to allow your client to `loginAs` themselves and get access the Permit Element.

The backend `loginAs` route is matched based on the Authentication methods you have implemented inside your App. Most applications
authenticate with the **Bearer Token** or **Cookies**, but we also allows you to use any other **HTTP Security Header**. The important
part here is, that you use the appropriate code example below based on your Authentication method.

The `loginAs` function takes two parameters. You need to pass in the unique `userId` you get from your **JWT** (JSON Web Token),
and a `tenant_key` or `tenantId`.

```js
permit.elements.loginAs({ userId, tenant });
```

:::info IMPORTANT
The **user must belong to the tenant** that he will be logged into. If he is not, you will see a login error saying `USER_NOT_FOUND`.

If the user gets logged out, he also exits the current tenant specificed in the `loginAs` method. If you want to **change tenants** for
a user, you need to **log them out**, and **log them back in** to a different tenant.
:::

Passing in the tenant is **compulsory** when logging in a user **server-side**.

<CodeDropdown
    number="2.1"
    title="Using Cookies"
    server
    code={[
        code.cookies_node,
        code.cookies_python,
        code.cookies_dotnet,
        code.cookies_java,
    ]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
></CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
    number="2.2"
    title="Using Bearer Token"
    server
    code={[
        code.bearer_node,
        code.bearer_python,
        code.bearer_dotnet,
        code.bearer_java,
    ]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
></CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
    number="2.3"
    title="Using Other Headers"
    server
    code={[
        code.bearer_node,
        code.bearer_python,
        code.bearer_dotnet,
        code.bearer_java,
    ]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
>
    If you use custom Authentication Header to authenticate to your backend, add
    this route to your backend.
</CodeDropdown>
<CodeDropdown
    number="2.4"
    title="Using frontendOnly"
    server
    code={[
        "When using frontendOnly\nyou don't need to add code to your backend.\nInstead you need to add your JWKS object to Permit.\nmake sure that your permit user key is the same as jwt sub or pass `userKeyClaim` in the login to point to the right claim. see 4.4 section\n ",
    ]}
    language={["frontendOnly"]}
    languages={["frontendOnly"]}
>
    First open your Permit Dashboard and go to the **Elements** page. Then click
    on **Configure JWKS** on the upper left corner and add your JWKS to the
    dialog. Then paste your JWKS into the text dialog and click **OK**.
    _![Configure JWKS](/img/elements/configure-jwks.png)_ Now make sure that your
    Permit user key is the same as the jwt sub. You can see your permit user key
    in the **Users** page in the Permit Dashboard. You can see your jwt sub with
    sites like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). Just paste your jwt token into the text
    dialog check in the left side the sub field.
</CodeDropdown>

### Install Permit-js

Once you have your application ready, you need to install Permits's JS SDK. This gives you access to our prebuilt embeddable Element components.

<CodeDropdown
    number="3"
    title=""
    client
    code={[code.npm, code.yarn]}
    showLineNumbers={false}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["npm", "yarn"]}
    open
>
    Add the Permit JavaScript SDK to you app:
</CodeDropdown>

### Client-side login method

This function should be called as early as possible in your App. This is best done inside a `App`/`index` file; **right after** the users
had just had their identity confirmed by the Authorization provider you are using, but **just before** the Embededd component is loaded.

With any of these login frontend methods, it's **optional** to pass in your **tenant key**, in comparison to the server-side call where **it
is required**. The server-side tenant will **always take precedence**. We do however encourage passing in the same tenant in your frontend
and backend login calls for best practices and for adding clarity to your code.

<CodeDropdown
    number="4"
    title=""
    client
    code={[code.elementLogin]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["Node"]}
    open
>
    This is the permit element object that is calling the backend route we have
    configured previously and logging in the user.

</CodeDropdown>

There are **four** things that need to be configured here:

1.  `loginUrl` - The url that corresponds to your backend login route you created in the last step.
2.  `loginMethod` - The login method you are using in your backend.
3.  `tenant` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method. the name of the tenant that the user is part of, you can set it at your backend as well, if you are using frontendOnly this is required.
4.  `token` (Optional) - Required for bearer token login method, you need to pass the token here.
5.  `headers` (Optional) - Required for custom headers login method, you need to pass the headers here.
6.  `userJwt` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the user jwt here.
7.  `envId` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the env id here.

There are **4 supported login options** choose the one that you are using in your backend.

<CodeDropdown
    number="4.1"
    title="Cookie Login Method"
    client
    code={[code.loginDefault]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open={false}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.cookie`.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
    number="4.2"
    title="Bearer Token Login Method"
    client
    code={[code.loginHeaders]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open={false}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.bearer`
    and the **token** should be set to the current user token.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
    number="4.3"
    title="Other Header Login Method"
    client
    code={[code.other_headers]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open={false}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.header`
    and you should pass the **headers** to the current user auth headers.
</CodeDropdown>
<CodeDropdown
    number="4.4"
    title="FrontendOnly"
    client
    code={[
        code.frontendOnlyLogin
    ]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.frontendOnly`
    **userJwt** should be set to the current user token.
    **tenant** should be set to the tenant you want to get access to, the current user must have role assigned to him in
    this tenant.
    **envId** should be set to the environment id you want to get access to, you need to make sure you have set the JWKS
    in this env see step 2.4, you can get your env id with [this api
    call](https://api.permit.io/v2/docs#/Environments/list_environments).Or take it from the get code dialog in the
    Permit Elements Dashboard.
    **userKeyClaim** (Optional) - Optional for frontendOnly login method, if your user key in Permit isn't the same as
    the jwt `sub` claim, you need to pass the key of the claim here.

</CodeDropdown>
After you run login successfully you will **get a cookie** called `permit_session` which will allow you to
load your Permit Element securly and successfully.

### Client-side logout method

This function should be called along with the logging-out logic that you have within your App, to make sure the user does not
continue to have access to the Permit Element.

<CodeDropdown
    number="5"
    title=""
    client
    code={[code.elementLogout]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open
>
    This logout method **should be called** as part of the logic of logging your
    user out with your authentication solution.
</CodeDropdown>

### Login Errors

There are a few possible errors you might find yourself come across while working with the embedding of Permit Elements.

| Error                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USER_NOT_FOUND`           | This error can appear if you are trying to log in as a particular user, but that **user does not exist within Permit**. You can also experience this login error when you are trying to login a user into a **tenant that he does not belong to**. |
| `TENANT_NOT_FOUND`         | This error can appear when you are passing in a tenant, either in the frontend `permit.elements.login` function, or in your backend URL endpoint, where the tenant has not been created in Permit.                                                 |
| `INVALID_PERMISSION_LEVEL` | This error will emerge when you are trying to access part of the Element which you have not been given access too. This usually means the role that the person obtained has remained in the **Hidden Roles** permission level.                     |
| `FORBIDDEN_ACCESS`         | This error will emerge when you are trying to login to an Element you have not been given permission to see.                                                                                                                                       |

### Embedding the Element
This element consists of two parts, the first part is the access request and the second part is in the user management element.

#### Access Request Element
Access requests are used to request access to resources. You can use it to request access to a resource. As an example, a viewer type user cannot see the post editing screen, so he receives the access request screen.
In the elements screen you must create a new access request.

### Match your brand

With every new element, you will be able to adjust several setting to make the look and feel of the element really your own.

<div className="list">
    <ul>
        <li>
			<span>
			    The element must be connected to the Connected User Management Element before we can begin working on it.
			</span>
        </li>
        <li>
			<span>
				Change the background and primary colour of any element to match your
				brand.
			</span>
        </li>
        <li>
			<span>
				Give the element a title, message and text in button, that makes sense to your end user, or hide it
				fully.
			</span>
        </li>

    </ul>
</div>


### User Management Element
In section Approval Component in user management element you can connect a access request component.

The button's color can be changed according to your theme.

The Approval Flow section allows you to change which details will be displayed and which won't




### AI agents
Today, most application users are humans - but this reality is bound to change drastically in the coming years, as other applications, such as AI and machine learning agents, will suppress human users.
These agents tend to perform actions much faster, much more frequently, and on an unprecedented scale. It is also often hard to know exactly which data these agents will require access to.
As completely blocking these agents defeats the purpose, we require a way to grant humans control over these agents in an organized way while maintaining the speed and scale they offer.

Traditional models like Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where developers solely assigned permissions, have given way to Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
This shift is crucial in the era of AI and cloud-native architectures, where users often need to grant access to third-party AI applications
and define unknown data scopes.

The **Approval Flows Element and API** addresses these complexities by enabling a dynamic, policy-based approval process.
It allows developers to create flexible approval flows where permissions can be dynamically adjusted through policy changes,
catering to the complex nature of AI agent interactions. It empowers users to control access to their data by AI agents,
maintaining security and compliance.

### Early Access

Permit.io Approval Flows is currently in Early Access, and we will gradually open the feature to more users.
