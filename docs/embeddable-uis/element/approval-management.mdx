# Approval Management Element

<span className="subtitle-custom">
The Approval Management Element is a Frontend component that shows you Operation Approvals. Easily approve or deny Operation Approvals.
</span>

</span>


## Overview

The Approval Management Element allows users with role "Operation Approval Reviewer" to manage pending requests efficiently.
This element based on [Operation Approval element](/embeddable-uis/element/operation-approval), reviewer and approval roles both will be created on the operation approval element. For view the operation approvals that have been created you will need to assigned the relevant user to the reviewer role.

After the request will approve, the requesting user will be automatically assigned to the approve role (on the relvent resource instance for his request).
 The element displays a list of pending requests, and the reviewer can approve or deny them. The element is designed to be embedded in your application, and it is fully customizable to fit your application's look and feel.



**Example**

Take the example of a bank transfer in the marketing department.
An employee in the marketing department wants to transfer money to an advertising supplier.
An employee cannot make a transfer, he needs approval from a manager, the manager of the marketing department approves the transfer.
A bank transfer is initiated by the employee, and the manager approves it via the Approval Management interface.

![create-approval-management](/img/approval-flows/approval-management/approval-m-inelement-screen.png)


### 2. Give the element a name, and click on "Create".

![create-approval-management](/img/approval-flows/approval-management/approval-management-before-create.png)


Our element has now been created, is ready to be edited and customized to our needs!


## Element Customization

With every new element, you will be able to adjust it to ensure the look and feel of it fits your application. 

<div className="list">
    <ul>
        <li>
			<span>
                You can change the background color and the color of the buttons
			</span>
        </li>
            <li>
			<span>
                You can show the user email, reason and date & time
			</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

![create-approval-management](/img/approval-flows/approval-management/approval-management-with-setting.png)

In the approval management element, you can also change the button color according to your theme, and toggle which details will be displayed.



## Creating an iFrame

In your newly created element, click the "Generate Code" button on the top of the screen

[//]: # (//todo change this)
![embed-code](/img/approval-flows/approval-management/embed-code.png)

A code snippet for the element will be generated for you.
This will be an `<iframe>` that you can insert anywhere into your application. It will look like the code snippet below:

:::note
Note that it is crutial to select the Tenant relevant for this element for it to fuction properly.
:::

#### The dynamic values in src are:
- <ELEMENT_NAME> - The name of the element you have created.

Replace them with your values.

```html
<iframe
	title="Permit Element Name"
	src="https://embed.permit.io/<ELEMENT_NAME>?envId=<SOME_UNIQUE_ID>&darkMode=false"
	width="100%"
	height="100%"
	style="border: none;"
/>
```

Once the iframe is ready, we need to embed it. To do that, you'll need to create a login. In the next section, we'll walk you through logging in. Choose a way to log in that's convenient for you:

## Embedding the Element

<div className="video-container">
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGYdDF65lkQ"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameBorder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

### Initializing Permit

<CodeDropdown
    number="1"
    title=""
    server
    code={[code.initialize_node, code.initialize_python, code.initialize_dotnet, code.initialize_java]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
>
    {/* If you are already using Permit, you can skip this step. */}
    In order to use Permit Elements, you need to be a **user of Permit**. When starting to use Permit, you will need to
    initialize an instance of Permit in your backend logic. This **only needs to be done once**, both to use Permit and
    Elements.
    Please remember to copy your `SDK Secret Key` and pass it into the initialized Permit object.

</CodeDropdown>

### Server-side Login Route

You need to create a route in your backend server to allow your client to `loginAs` themselves and get access the Permit Element.

The backend `loginAs` route is matched based on the Authentication methods you have implemented inside your App. Most applications
authenticate with the **Bearer Token** or **Cookies**, but we also allows you to use any other **HTTP Security Header**. The important
part here is, that you use the appropriate code example below based on your Authentication method.

The `loginAs` function takes two parameters. You need to pass in the unique `userId` you get from your **JWT** (JSON Web Token),
and a `tenant_key` or `tenantId`.

```js
permit.elements.loginAs({ userId, tenant });
```

:::info IMPORTANT
The **user must belong to the tenant** that he will be logged into. If he is not, you will see a login error saying `USER_NOT_FOUND`.

If the user gets logged out, he also exits the current tenant specificed in the `loginAs` method. If you want to **change tenants** for
a user, you need to **log them out**, and **log them back in** to a different tenant.
:::

Passing in the tenant is **compulsory** when logging in a user **server-side**.

<CodeDropdown
    number="2.1"
    title="Using Cookies"
    server
    code={[
        code.cookies_node,
        code.cookies_python,
        code.cookies_dotnet,
        code.cookies_java,
    ]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
></CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
    number="2.2"
    title="Using Bearer Token"
    server
    code={[
        code.bearer_node,
        code.bearer_python,
        code.bearer_dotnet,
        code.bearer_java,
    ]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}

    server
    code={[
        code.bearer_node,
        code.bearer_python,
        code.bearer_dotnet,
        code.bearer_java,
    ]}
    language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
    languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
>
    If you use custom Authentication Header to authenticate to your backend, add
    this route to your backend.
</CodeDropdown>
<CodeDropdown
    number="2.4"
    title="Using frontendOnly"
    server
    code={[
        "When using frontendOnly\nyou don't need to add code to your backend.\nInstead you need to add your JWKS object to Permit.\nmake sure that your permit user key is the same as jwt sub or pass `userKeyClaim` in the login to point to the right claim. see 4.4 section\n ",
    ]}
    language={["frontendOnly"]}
    languages={["frontendOnly"]}
>
    First open your Permit Dashboard and go to the **Elements** page. Then click
    on **Configure JWKS** on the upper left corner and add your JWKS to the
    dialog. Then paste your JWKS into the text dialog and click **OK**.
    _![Configure JWKS](/img/elements/configure-jwks.png)_ Now make sure that your
    Permit user key is the same as the jwt sub. You can see your permit user key
    in the **Users** page in the Permit Dashboard. You can see your jwt sub with
    sites like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). Just paste your jwt token into the text
    dialog check in the left side the sub field.
</CodeDropdown>

### Install Permit-js

Once you have your application ready, you need to install Permits's JS SDK. This gives you access to our prebuilt embeddable Element components.

<CodeDropdown
    number="3"
    title=""
    client
    code={[code.npm, code.yarn]}
    showLineNumbers={false}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["npm", "yarn"]}
    open
>
    Add the Permit JavaScript SDK to you app:
</CodeDropdown>

### Client-side login method

This function should be called as early as possible in your App. This is best done inside a `App`/`index` file; **right after** the users
had just had their identity confirmed by the Authorization provider you are using, but **just before** the Embededd component is loaded.

With any of these login frontend methods, it's **optional** to pass in your **tenant key**, in comparison to the server-side call where **it
is required**. The server-side tenant will **always take precedence**. We do however encourage passing in the same tenant in your frontend
and backend login calls for best practices and for adding clarity to your code.

<CodeDropdown
    number="4"
    title=""
    client
    code={[code.elementLogin]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["Node"]}
    open
>
    This is the permit element object that is calling the backend route we have
    configured previously and logging in the user.

</CodeDropdown>

There are **four** things that need to be configured here:

1.  `loginUrl` - The url that corresponds to your backend login route you created in the last step.
2.  `loginMethod` - The login method you are using in your backend.
3.  `tenant` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method. the name of the tenant that the user is part of, you can set it at your backend as well, if you are using frontendOnly this is required.
4.  `token` (Optional) - Required for bearer token login method, you need to pass the token here.
5.  `headers` (Optional) - Required for custom headers login method, you need to pass the headers here.
6.  `userJwt` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the user jwt here.
7.  `envId` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the env id here.

There are **4 supported login options** choose the one that you are using in your backend.

<CodeDropdown
    number="4.1"
    title="Cookie Login Method"
    client
    code={[code.loginDefault]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open={false}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.cookie`.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
    number="4.2"
    title="Bearer Token Login Method"
    client
    code={[code.loginHeaders]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open={false}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.bearer`
    and the **token** should be set to the current user token.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
    number="4.3"
    title="Other Header Login Method"
    client
    code={[code.other_headers]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open={false}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.header`
    and you should pass the **headers** to the current user auth headers.
</CodeDropdown>
<CodeDropdown
    number="4.4"
    title="FrontendOnly"
    client
    code={[
        code.frontendOnlyLogin
    ]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
>
    The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.frontendOnly`
    **userJwt** should be set to the current user token.
    **tenant** should be set to the tenant you want to get access to, the current user must have role assigned to him in
    this tenant.
    **envId** should be set to the environment id you want to get access to, you need to make sure you have set the JWKS
    in this env see step 2.4, you can get your env id with [this api
    call](https://api.permit.io/v2/docs#/Environments/list_environments).Or take it from the get code dialog in the
    Permit Elements Dashboard.
    **userKeyClaim** (Optional) - Optional for frontendOnly login method, if your user key in Permit isn't the same as
    the jwt `sub` claim, you need to pass the key of the claim here.

</CodeDropdown>
After you run login successfully you will **get a cookie** called `permit_session` which will allow you to
load your Permit Element securly and successfully.

### Client-side logout method

This function should be called along with the logging-out logic that you have within your App, to make sure the user does not
continue to have access to the Permit Element.

<CodeDropdown
    number="5"
    title=""
    client
    code={[code.elementLogout]}
    language={["javascript"]}
    languages={["JS"]}
    open
>
    This logout method **should be called** as part of the logic of logging your
    user out with your authentication solution.
</CodeDropdown>

### Login Errors

There are a few possible errors you might find yourself come across while working with the embedding of Permit Elements.

| Error                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USER_NOT_FOUND`           | This error can appear if you are trying to log in as a particular user, but that **user does not exist within Permit**. You can also experience this login error when you are trying to login a user into a **tenant that he does not belong to**. |
| `TENANT_NOT_FOUND`         | This error can appear when you are passing in a tenant, either in the frontend `permit.elements.login` function, or in your backend URL endpoint, where the tenant has not been created in Permit.                                                 |
| `INVALID_PERMISSION_LEVEL` | This error will emerge when you are trying to access part of the Element which you have not been given access too. This usually means the role that the person obtained has remained in the **Hidden Roles** permission level.                     |
| `FORBIDDEN_ACCESS`         | This error will emerge when you are trying to login to an Element you have not been given permission to see.                                                                                                                                       |
