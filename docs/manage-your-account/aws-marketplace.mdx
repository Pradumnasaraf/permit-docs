## How & Why to Subscribe:

**Subscribing to Permit** via AWS Marketplace **streamlines** billing by consolidating charges into your AWS invoice, and **simplifies**
procurement through pre-approved vendor status. It also **ensures compliance** with AWS security standards, offers **flexible
subscription management**, and may provide cost benefits through AWS discount programs.
