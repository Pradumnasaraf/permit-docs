title: Advanced Authorization Queries
---

Authorization plays a crucial role in managing secure access to your systems, and advanced queries can make this process more
precise and powerful. In this guide, we’ll explore various methods to retrieve permissions, manage authorized users,
and efficiently sync user data with Permit.

## Get User Permissions

Use the `permit.GetUserPermissions` function to retrieve all user permissions across all registered resources and tenants.
Simply provide a "User" as input, optionally filter by a list of tenants, and receive an object detailing the permissions
and attributes for each assigned tenant.

## Get Authorized Users

Use the `permit.authorized_users` function to retrieve a list of users authorized to perform a specific action on a resource.
This function takes an action and resource as inputs and returns the authorized users along with their role assignments that
granted access.

## Bulk User Synchronization

If you need to migrate an entire database of users to Permit, there are two primary approaches to achieve this.

### Script-Based Bulk Syncing

Create a script that leverages the Permit API or SDK to iterate through your user dataset and push all users into Permit. This
approach allows you to transfer your existing database in one go, ensuring all users are immediately available in Permit. However,
it may require additional effort for scripting and execution, and you’ll need to handle any potential errors or data inconsistencies
during the process.

### Incremental Syncing at Login (Recommended)

A more efficient and seamless method is to sync users incrementally at the handoff point—the moment users interact with your system.
Specifically, during the login process, as soon as a user's identity is verified, they are synced into Permit.

This approach eliminates the need for pre-loading an entire dataset, reducing upfront work and ensuring only active users are synced.
Over time, as users log in, the entire user base will naturally sync into Permit, aligning with real-world activity in your system.

:::tip KEY ADVANTAGE
Incremental syncing aligns with user behavior, ensuring your database stays current and avoids syncing inactive or outdated users.

## What did you learn?

:::tip FUN FACT
Did you know? The concept of "authorization" dates back to ancient times when officials used wax seals on documents to verify
permission. Today, we use advanced databases and APIs, but the goal remains the same—ensuring the right people have access to
the right things.
