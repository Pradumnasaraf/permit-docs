Welcome to your step-by-step guide for syncing application data into **Permit.io**. By the end of this walkthrough, you'll understand
the nuances of managing user data, including roles, tenants, and permissions.

## Before we start: Understand Permit Data

There are many variations of data that you can sync into Permit. Each `User`, `Resource`, `Resource Instance`, `Tenant` and a `Role`
in itself can have attributes.

Attributes in permission management systems are key-value pairs that describe properties or characteristics. They can be used
to create permissions that are far more granular, and are most often found to be used in ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control)
models.

## User Attributes

User attributes are essential in permission management systems, as they describe the characteristics of users that influence
their access rights. These attributes can include **roles**, **departments**, **locations**, and **more**.

To add User Attributes, navigate to `Directory > Settings > User Attributes`.

As you can tell, Permit gives us some pre-defined attributes every user in the system gets by default (`role`, `email` and `key`).
To add your own custom attributes, just click `Add Attribute`, select the **name**, it's **value type** - (whether it's a String, Number,
Boolean etc.) - and a description if necessary.

## Tenant Attributes

Tenant attributes describe properties or characteristics of a tenant, which typically represents a group, organization, or
account within a multi-tenant system. These attributes help differentiate tenants and apply access control policies based on
their specific requirements.

For example:

- **Region**: Defines the geographical location of the tenant, such as North America, Europe, or Asia.
- **Subscription Level**: Specifies the service tier, such as Basic, Pro, or Enterprise.
- **Industry**: Indicates the tenant's sector, like Healthcare, Finance, or Retail.

:::tip EXAMPLE
Using tenant attributes, you can enforce policies like:

"Allow access to advanced analytics only for tenants with a Pro or Enterprise subscription."

## Role Attributes (EAP)

Role attributes define the properties of roles within a system, adding another dimension of specificity. These attributes
describe a role's capabilities or context, making role-based access control (RBAC) more dynamic and adaptable.

For example:

- **Access Scope**: Local, Global, or Regional access.
- **Permission Level**: Read-Only, Write, or Admin access.
- **Specialization**: Role-specific focus, such as Data Analyst or IT Admin.

:::tip EXAMPLE
Role attributes can be used to refine permissions further, enabling policies like:

"Grant Global write access only to roles with an Admin permission level."

## Resource Attributes

Resource attributes define specific characteristics of a resource, enabling fine-grained and context-aware access control.
These attributes are added when creating a new resource in Permit by specifying them during the setup process.

For example:

- **Type**: Indicates the category of the resource, such as Document or Widget.
- **Classification**: Indicates the sensitivity level, such as Public, Internal, or Confidential.

To create a Resource Attribute in Permit, simply go to `Policy > Create > Resource` and define these attributes
to tailor your access control policies effectively.

## Bulk User Synchronization

If you need to migrate an entire database of users to Permit, there are two primary approaches to achieve this.

### Script-Based Bulk Syncing

Create a script that leverages the Permit API or SDK to iterate through your user dataset and push all users into Permit. This
approach allows you to transfer your existing database in one go, ensuring all users are immediately available in Permit. However,
it may require additional effort for scripting and execution, and you’ll need to handle any potential errors or data inconsistencies
during the process.

### Incremental Syncing at Login (Recommended)

A more efficient and seamless method is to sync users incrementally at the handoff point—the moment users interact with your system.
Specifically, during the login process, as soon as a user's identity is verified, they are synced into Permit.

This approach eliminates the need for pre-loading an entire dataset, reducing upfront work and ensuring only active users are synced.
Over time, as users log in, the entire user base will naturally sync into Permit, aligning with real-world activity in your system.

:::tip KEY ADVANTAGE
Incremental syncing aligns with user behavior, ensuring your database stays current and avoids syncing inactive or outdated users.

:::tip FUN FACT!
Did you know that the concept of data synchronization dates back to the early days of telecommunication?

In the 19th century, synchronization was first used to align clocks for railway systems to prevent train collisions.
