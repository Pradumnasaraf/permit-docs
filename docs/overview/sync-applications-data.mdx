Welcome to your step-by-step guide for syncing application data into **Permit.io**. By the end of this walkthrough, you'll understand
the nuances of managing user data, including users, tenants, their permissions - and most importantly, how we can sync all this
data in advance of performing any authorization queries.

## Before we start: Understand Permit Data

There are many variations of data that you can sync into Permit. Each `User`, `Resource`, `Resource Instance` and a `Tenant`
in itself can have attributes.

:::note
It's crucial to understand that most permissions rely heavily on additional data to function effectively.
:::

Attributes in permission management systems are key-value pairs that describe properties or characteristics. They can be used
to create permissions that are far more granular, and are most often found to be used in ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control)
models.

:::note
Permit Application Data can be added manually by using the Permit UI and via the API. We will be showing how to work with both
methods.

## Users & User Attributes (ABAC)

### via the UI

User attributes are essential in permission management systems, as they describe the characteristics of users that influence
their access rights. These attributes can include **roles**, **departments**, **locations**, and **more**.

To add attributes for a user through the dashboard:

1. Navigate to `Directory`.
2. Select the user you want to modify.
3. Click the `three dots` menu next to their name and choose `Edit Attributes`.
4. Add the desired attribute values as needed and `Save`.

### via the API

You can also manage user attributes programmatically using the Permit API. This is especially useful for bulk operations or
integrating attribute management into your existing systems.

#### Endpoint

To create user attributes, use the following endpoint:

```bash
/v2/schema/{proj_id}/{env_id}/users/attributes
```

Replace `{proj_id}` and `{env_id}` with your project and environment identifiers.

#### Example Request

Hereâ€™s an example using cURL to create a new user attribute:

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/my_project/my_environment/users/attributes \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "key": "private",
  "type": "bool",
  "description": "whether or not the github repository is private"
}'
```

## Tenants & Tenant Attributes (ABAC and ReBAC)

Tenant attributes describe properties or characteristics of a tenant, which typically represents a group, organization, or
account within a multi-tenant system. These attributes help differentiate tenants and apply access control policies based on
their specific requirements.

For example:

- **Region**: Defines the geographical location of the tenant, such as North America, Europe, or Asia.
- **Subscription Level**: Specifies the service tier, such as Basic, Pro, or Enterprise.
- **Industry**: Indicates the tenant's sector, like Healthcare, Finance, or Retail.

:::tip EXAMPLE
Using tenant attributes, you can enforce policies like:

"Allow access to advanced analytics only for tenants with a Pro or Enterprise subscription."
:::

### via the UI

To manage tenant attributes using the dashboard:

1. Navigate to `Directory`.
2. Go to `Settings`.
3. Select `Manage Tenants`.
4. Find the tenant you want to update, click the `three dots` next to it, and choose `Edit Attributes`.

Add or modify attributes as needed, specifying the name and value as a JSON object.

## Role Assignments (RBAC & ReBAC)

When syncing data into Permit.io, configuring role assignments is a critical step. Role assignments define what actions a user
can perform, either at a global level (RBAC) or in relation to specific resources (ReBAC). Permit supports both models to give
you maximum flexibility.

### RBAC: Top-Level Roles

In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), users are assigned roles globally or within a tenant. These roles determine the user's
overall access and permissions.

Creating Top-Level Roles is simple:

1. Navigate to `Policy > Roles`.
2. Select `Add Role`.
3. Specify the required **Name** of the role. The key will generate automatically form the name, but you can change it.
4. You can add an **optional description**.
5. Click `Save`.

### ReBAC: Instance Roles

In Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC), role assignments are context-specific and tied to particular resource instances.
This model enables fine-grained control, where permissions depend on the relationship between a user and a resource.

To create a Instance Role, the process is the same as for a Top-Level role, with an additional step:

1. After following all the above Top-Level Role creation, select the toggle for `Instance Role`.
2. Select the `Resource` you want the instance role to be on.
3. Create the `Role Derivation` for the specific instance role.
4. Click `Save`.

## Resource Instances and Resource Instance Attributes (ReBAC)

Resource attributes define specific characteristics of a resource, enabling fine-grained and context-aware access control.
These attributes are added when creating a new resource in Permit by specifying them during the setup process.

### via the UI

To manage resource instance attributes in the UI:

1. Navigate to `Directory > Instances`.
2. Select the specific resource instance you want to add attributes for.
3. Click the `three dots` and select `Edit Attributes`.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Relationship Tuples (ReBAC)

Relationship tuples form the backbone of ReBAC, defining how entities like users, resources, and tenants relate to each other.
These tuples make access control dynamic and contextual.

The format for each relation tuple is as follows:

`<Subject> : <Relation> : <Object>`

:::tip Example Tuples
**user:123 member_of tenant:tenantA**: User 123 is a member of Tenant A.
**user:987 parent_of resource:resourceB**: User 789 owns Resource B.
:::

To configure relationship tuples in Permit:

1. Navigate to `Directory > Instances`.
2. Select the resource instance you would like to define a tuple for, click the `three dots` and `Edit Resource Instance`.
3. Under `Relationship` click `Add Relationship`.
4. Define the Subject, Relation, and Object.
5. Click `Save`.

Example Policy:

`Allow a user to manage a resource if they are the owner of that resource.`

:::tip FUN FACT!
Did you know that the concept of data synchronization dates back to the early days of telecommunication?

In the 19th century, synchronization was first used to align clocks for railway systems to prevent train collisions.
