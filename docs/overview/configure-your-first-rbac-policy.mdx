**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a method for managing access to resources by assigning permissions based on user
roles. It simplifies security management by ensuring users only have access to what they need to perform their job. For a
deeper dive into RBAC and its benefits, check out our [What is RBAC](https://www.permit.io/rbac) page or explore our
detailed [blog post](https://www.permit.io/blog/what-is-rbac).

In this guide, you'll learn how to configure your first RBAC policy, step by stepâ€”starting with creating roles, defining
resources and actions, and assigning roles to users.

## timeline-start

## Creating your first role

The first step in configuring your RBAC policy is to define roles, which represent a set of permissions associated with
specific actions and resources. Roles are the foundation of RBAC, as they determine what a user can or cannot do within
the system.

In this example, we will create a role called **Admin**, which typically represents a user with the highest level of access.

To create the Admin role:

1. Navigate to the Policy Screen
2. Click `Create a Role`
3. Enter "Admin" as the name of the role. Make sure the name is clear and meaningful, reflecting the purpose of the role.
   You can also pass a `key` to uniquely identify a role and a `description` to offer a more meaningful explanation of the role.

## Creating a resource and its actions

With the **Admin** role created, the next step is to define a **resource** and **the actions** users can perform on it. A
resource represents any entity or object in your system that requires controlled accessâ€”such as a **file**, a **database
entry**, or, in our example, a `Document`. By associating specific actions with this resource, you can granularly control
what roles can do with it.

In this example, weâ€™ll create a resource called `Document`. Weâ€™ll start by leveraging Permitâ€™s basic pre-defined
actions â€” `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` (often referred to as **CRUD**). These actions cover fundamental operations
that are common across most systems. Additionally, to better reflect our use case, weâ€™ll add a custom action called
**`publish`**, which represents a more specific operation relevant to document management.

This combination of predefined and bespoke actions gives you flexibility in crafting access policies tailored to
your applicationâ€™s needs.

## Add a user and assign a role

Now that weâ€™ve defined a role, a resource, and its associated actions, itâ€™s time to **bring a user into the system** and
grant them access.

:::tip
A users represent individuals or entities that will interact with your application, and roles determine
what they can do.
:::

For this example, weâ€™ll add a user with the email **`sam@permit.io`** and assign them the `Admin` role we created earlier.
This will give Sam full administrative permissions to manage resources and perform all actions defined for this role.
Assigning roles to users is a critical step, as it connects your RBAC setup to real-world access control, ensuring only
the right people can access and modify resources.

## Configuring RBAC permissions in the Policy editor

Finally, with our roles, resources, and users in place, we need to define the exact permissions for the Admin role.
This is done in the Policy Editor, where you can specify what actions each role is allowed to perform on a given resource.

In this example, weâ€™ll configure the Admin role to have limited access to the Document resource. This includes the basic `create`
and `read` actions â€” as well as the custom `publish` action we previously defined. By precisely mapping actions to roles
in the Policy Editor, you ensure your access control model is both secure and flexible, aligning with your application's
requirements.

Once this step is complete, your RBAC setup is ready, and the Admin role will have all the necessary permissions to
manage the Document resource effectively.

## What did you learn?

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve successfully configured your first **RBAC** policy by creating a role, defining a resource with
actions, assigning a user, and setting permissions. This foundational setup is the cornerstone of a secure and scalable
access control system.

:::tip FUN FACT!
RBAC is so effective that itâ€™s used by NASA to manage access to mission-critical systems! By leveraging roles and
permissions, they ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with sensitive spacecraft operations and data.
