# MCPermit – The Permissions Gateway for Agentic AI Tools (MCPs)

Permit.io’s MCPermit is a drop-in security gateway for AI agent platforms, giving organizations instant control and visibility over every MCP (Model Context Protocol) server interaction.

With a single configuration change, MCPermit wraps your AI agents’ tool access in enterprise-grade security: identity-based access checks, comprehensive audit trails, and human-in-the-loop approvals. **No SDKs, no code changes**—just route traffic through MCPermit to decide who (user or agent) can do *what*, log *every* request, and keep AI-driven workflows compliant and safe.



### The Challenge: Uncontrolled AI Agents and Invisible Risks  

Enterprise adoption of *agentic AI* is surging, but security controls haven’t kept pace. Teams now deploy and consume **MCP servers**—the “USB-C for AI” that lets LLM agents plug into apps and data—without consistent oversight. Traditional API gateways and IAM tools were never designed for autonomous, context-driven agents. The result is a web of AI “assistants” acting with real privileges yet operating outside normal monitoring.  
Organizations and CISOs face critical questions:

* Which AI agents are touching which systems?  
* What data are they accessing?  
* Who ultimately authorized those actions?

### The Solution: MCPermit Gateway—Unified Control Over AI Tool Access  

**MCPermit** is purpose-built to answer those questions. Acting as a smart proxy between AI agents (MCP clients) and the tools or data they seek (MCP servers), MCPermit authenticates, authorizes, and audits every interaction. Think of it as a **zero-trust checkpoint for AI actions**:

1. **Authenticate** the originator (human) and the agent acting on their behalf.  
2. **Authorize** the requested action against fine-grained policy.  
3. **Audit** the outcome for compliance and threat-hunting.

All this happens transparently—no modification to AI agents or MCP servers, just a URL switch.

### Key Capabilities & Differentiators

- **Fine-Grained, Identity-Based Access Control**  
  * Combine user identity, agent identity, and resource scope in one policy.  
  * Enforce true least-privilege down to individual MCP functions.

- **Unified Policy Across Users, Agents, and Tools**  
  * One central policy layer instead of scattered configs.  
  * Rules consistently apply to internal or third-party MCP servers.

- **Complete Visibility & Auditing**  
  * Real-time logs of every agent action with rich context.  
  * Immediate traceability for incident response and compliance reporting.

- **Human-in-the-Loop Workflows**  
  * Configurable step-up approvals for sensitive operations.  
  * Optional but critical when AI touches high-risk data or funds.

- **SSO & Directory Integration**  
  * Leverages your existing SSO (OIDC, SAML, LDAP).  
  * Aligns agent permissions with HR groups and existing role structures.

- **Drop-In Deployment—No Code Changes**  
  * Works as a proxy; adopt by routing MCP traffic to the gateway.  
  * Roll out governance in minutes, even across dozens of AI integrations.

- **Instant Governance & Compliance Assurance**  
  * Enforce data-privacy rules (GDPR, HIPAA) and strengthen SOC 2 controls.  
  * Stop unauthorized PII access or data exfiltration before it happens.

### Why MCPermit, Why Now?  

Boards and regulators are already asking how organizations will prevent AI-driven mishaps. MCP servers and agent frameworks multiply rapidly; unchecked, they create an **identity explosion** of machine agents and a blind spot in security. MCPermit closes that gap—delivering the visibility, control, and peace of mind security leaders need to let innovation flourish *without* compromising governance.


## Problem Statement – Risks & Compliance Gaps in Uncontrolled AI Access

1. **Lack of Visibility & Oversight**  
   * AI agents often act with powerful access yet leave no usable logs, making malicious or mistaken actions hard to detect.

2. **Unauthorized Actions & Privilege Abuse**  
   * Over-permissive agents can delete data, transfer funds, or leak secrets—whether by error, prompt injection, or insider threat.

3. **Shadow IT in AI Form**  
   * Teams spin up MCP integrations in minutes, bypassing standard review and creating unvetted connections into critical systems.

4. **Compliance & Data-Privacy Violations**  
   * Unchecked agent activities risk breaching GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 requirements when PII or regulated data is accessed or moved.

5. **Operational Chaos & Security Drift**  
   * Manual processes can’t keep pace with agent sprawl, leading to mismatched policies and difficulty in incident forensics.

**MCPermit tackles each of these pain points head-on**—providing the centralized gateway that enforces policy, logs every action, and ensures AI systems operate safely within your security and compliance framework.
