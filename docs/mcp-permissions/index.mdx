# MCP Permissions

MCPermit is a comprehensive permissions layer designed specifically for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It enables organizations to implement fine-grained access control for their AI agents while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

## Core Concepts

MCPermit combines several powerful technologies to deliver a complete permissions solution:

- **Fine-grained ReBAC**: Leverages Permit.io, OPA, and OPAL to implement relationship-based access control
- **Multi-stage Security**: Implements a five-stage authentication and authorization process
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Provides comprehensive auditing and anomaly detection capabilities
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports various delivery models to meet different infrastructure needs
- **Human Oversight**: Enables human-in-the-loop (HITL) approvals for critical decisions
