# Stress Test the PDP with Audit Log Replay


The Audit Log Replay API allows you to replay `permit.Check()` requests based on your existing audit logs. This powerful feature enables you to test your PDP configuration by simulating real traffic patterns without affecting your production environment.

:::caution FYI
**This feature is currently available to whitelisted organizations only!**

We're rolling it out carefully to ensure the best experience.
Want to use this feature? Reach out to our friendly support team via [Slack](https://io.permit.io/slack) and we'll be happy to add you to our VIP whitelist! 
:::
## Use Cases

- **Load Testing**: Test your PDP's capacity by replaying high-volume traffic
- **Regression Testing**: Verify that policy changes don't break existing permissions
- **Debugging**: Reproduce issues by replaying the exact request patterns from a specific time period
- **Performance Tuning**: Measure latency and throughput under different configurations

## API Endpoint

For complete API details and schema information, see the [Audit Log Replay API Reference](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/audit-log-replay/POST/v2/audit-log-replay).

```
POST /v2/audit-log-replay
```

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `pdp_url` | string | The URL of the target PDP instance to replay logs against |
| `start_time` | string (UNIX Timestamp) | Beginning of time range to replay logs from |
| `end_time` | string (UNIX Timestamp) | End of time range to replay logs from |
| `concurrency_limit` | integer | Number of concurrent requests to simulate |
| `graceful_shutdown_s` | object (optional) | Additional filters to apply to audit logs before replay |

## Example Request

```json
{
  "pdp_url": "https://example-pdp.permit.io",
  "start_time": "1740832387",
  "end_time": "1743507187",
  "concurrency": 5,
  "graceful_shutdown_s": 60
}
```

## Example Response

```json
{
"message": "Audit log replay started with 2599 documents",
"document_count": 2599
}
```



## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a short time range and low concurrency to understand the impact
2. **Target Testing PDP**: Always point to a test PDP instance, not production
4. **Consider Time Patterns**: Replay traffic from representative time periods (peak hours, etc.)
5. **Monitor Performance**: Watch your PDP metrics during replay to identify bottlenecks

## Limitations

- Maximum replay duration: 30 days
- Maximum concurrency: 10 (contact support for higher limits)
- Replay requests may be throttled based on your plan
- Maximum timeout for a session is 60 seconds
- Certain audit log types may not be replayable (Authorized-users, Bulk check, etc.)
