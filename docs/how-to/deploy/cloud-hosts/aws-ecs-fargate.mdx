# Step-by-step guide - Deploying PDP using AWS-ECS-Fargate

In this example, we will show you how to deploy the Permit PDP on AWS ECS Fargate.

### Task Definition Example
We have provided an example of a task definition that you can use to deploy the PDP on AWS ECS Fargate.

You can find the example in our Github repo:

https://github.com/permitio/permit-pdp-deployments-examples/blob/main/aws/ecs-task-definition.json.


### 1. Create a new ECS cluster

Create a new cluster in the ECS console.

### 2. Create Task definitions

Create a new task definition in the ECS console. Please pay attention to the following fields:
- container port(s) to open: 7000 (required) 8181 (optional)
  - 7000 is the port the PDP API runs on and is what the SDKs connect to for permit.check()
  - 8181 is the port OPA runs on and isn't required to be open. If you need access to OPA directly, open this port.
- Image URI: permitio/pdp-v2:latest
- CPU and Memory, please consider changing values in case of high load. (1 vCPU is a good number to start with)
- PDP_API_KEY - your API key
- (optional) PDP_OPA_CLIENT_QUERY_TIMEOUT - timeout in seconds for the request to the OPA client (default 1), for heavy checks you might want to set it to a higher number (like bulk, get_user_tenants, etc.)
