# Deploying PDP using raw Kubernetes YAMLs

In this example, we will show you how to deploy the Permit PDP on Kubernetes using raw YAMLs.

Resources included in this example:

- Deployment
- Service
- Secret

## To deploy the PDP on Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. Download the YAML files from [this directory](https://github.com/permitio/permit-pdp-deployments-examples/tree/main/kubernetes).
2. Replace the `PDP_API_KEY` value in the `secret.yaml` file with your API key.
3. Create a new namespace for the PDP - (You can choose which namespace you want).

```bash
kubectl create namespace permit-pdp
```

4. Apply the YAML files - make sure you are in the directory that contains the YAML files.

```bash
kubectl apply -f.
```

5. (Optional) Wait for the PDP to be ready.

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deployment/permit-pdp -n permit-pdp
```

Once the PDP is ready, you can start sending authorization requests to it.

## Interacting with the PDP

To interact with the PDP **internally** (from inside the cluster), you can use the service name `permit-pdp.<Your Namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.

To interact with the PDP **externally** (from outside the cluster), you must expose the service using a load balancer or an ingress of your choice.

## Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes

The PDP exposes several endpoints that can be used for liveness, readiness, and startup probes.

### Liveness Probe

The liveness probe is used to determine if the PDP is alive and healthy and should be restarted if it's not,
it returns a 200 status code if the PDP is alive and healthy. The liveness probe endpoint is `/health`.<br />
An unhealthy PDP will return a 503 status code when The PDP failure rate exceeds the configured threshold.
<!-- An unhealthy PDP will return a 503 status code on one of the following scenarios: -->
<!-- 1. The Policy Engine healthcheck returned an error or timed out. -->
<!-- 2. The PDP failure rate is more than the configured threshold -->

You can configure the failure threshold using environment variables:
1. `PDP_OPA_CLIENT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE` - The failure threshold percentage for the Policy Engine healthcheck. The default value is 10%.
2. `PDP_OPA_CLIENT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL` - The interval (in seconds) to calculate the failure threshold. The default value is 60 seconds.

The default configuration will return a 503 status code if at least 10% of the requests made to the PDP in the last 60 seconds failed.

### Readiness Probe

The readiness probe determines if the PDP is ready to receive traffic; it returns a 200 status code if the PDP is ready to receive traffic. The readiness probe endpoint is `/healthy`.<br />
An unready PDP will return a 503 status code if the Policy Engine's latest policy update fails.

### Startup Probe

The startup probe is used to determine if the PDP is ready to receive traffic on startup; it returns a 200 status code if the PDP has finished the startup and is ready to receive traffic. The startup probe endpoint is `/ready`.<br />
A PDP will be considered ready and return 200 once the Policy Engine has finished loading the policy from the policy store ( Git repository ) successfully.
