To get all users who have access to a resource, you can use the `permit.authorized_users` function.
This function returns a list of users who have access to perform a specific action on a resource.

The `permit.authorized_users` function accepts an action and a resource as input,
and returns a list of users who have access to perform the given action on the given resource,
including the user's role assignments that granted the access:

:::note PDP Version
Please note that the `permit.authorized_users` function is available starting from PDP version 0.4.0.

## Simple Usage


<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from permit import AuthorizedUsersResult

authorized_users: AuthorizedUsersResult = permit.authorized_users(
    "read", "repo",
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The schema of the response in the code above is as follows:
```json
{
    "resource": "repo:*",
    "tenant": "default",
    "users": {
        "user1": [
            {
                "user": "user1",
                "tenant": "default",
                "resource": "__tenant:default",
                "role": "admin"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Instance Specific Usage

Similar to the `permit.check` function, you can also pass the instance of the resource to the `permit.authorized_users` function.
This will return a list of users who have access to perform the given action on the specific given instance.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from permit import AuthorizedUsersResult

authorized_users: AuthorizedUsersResult = permit.authorized_users(
    "read", "repo:OPAL",
)

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The schema of the response in the code above is as follows:
```json
{
    "resource": "repo:OPAL",
    "tenant": "default",
    "users": {
        "user1": [
            {
                "user": "user1",
                "tenant": "default",
                "resource": "repo:OPAL",
                "role": "admin"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

If the user also has access to the resource granted by a tenant level role assignment,
the response will also contain the tenant level role assignment, and will look as follows:
```json
{
    "resource": "repo:OPAL",
    "tenant": "default",
    "users": {
        "user1": [
            {
                "user": "user1",
                "tenant": "default",
                "resource": "repo:OPAL",
                "role": "admin"
            },
            {
                "user": "user1",
                "tenant": "default",
                "resource": "__tenant:default",
                "role": "admin"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
