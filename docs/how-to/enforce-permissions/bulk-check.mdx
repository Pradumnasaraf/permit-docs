The permit bulk `check()` function allows you to validate multiple permission requests in a single call.

---

For some use cases, you might need to perform multiple `check()` calls at once.
To support that, Permit provides a `bulkCheck` function that allows you to validate multiple permission requests in a single call.
In its basic form, the bulk `check()` function accepts the same parameters as the `check()` function, but in an array.

## Use Cases
Below are some examples of the use cases that require the use of the `bulkCheck()` function:

### Latency Sensitive Applications
The most basic usage of a `bulkCheck` is to save time when multiple check calls are needed in one scope.
For example, assuming we have an API endpoint that performs multiple actions on a resource, we can use the `bulkCheck` function to check all the permissions at once.

```js
const permitted = await permit.bulkCheck([
    { user, "create", "document" },
    { user, "edit", "profile"}
]);
```


### Multiple Policy Models
In some cases, we want to perform ReBAC and ABAC checks for the same operations.
For example, if `edit` is a premium feature in our application (with ABAC) and we also want to check if the user has access to `edit` a document (with ReBAC), we can use the `bulkCheck` function to check both permissions at once.

```js
const {key, tier} = getUser(token);
const permissions = await permit.bulk([
    // Checking for relationship to the particular document
    { user: key, "edit", `document:${document.id}` },
    // Checking for the user's tier by user attributes
    { user: {key , attributes: {tier}}, "edit", `document:${document.id}` }
]);
const permitted = permissions[0] || permissions[1];
```

### Data Filtering
Data filtering is where we have a collection of data, and we want to filter it based on the permissions of the user.
While there are more efficient ways to perform data filtering with Permit, mapping mutliple permissions checks to a single `bulkCheck` call can be useful in some cases.

```js
const resources = getResources();
const permitted = await permit.bulkCheck(
    resources.map(resource => ({ user, "read", resource })
));
const permittedResources = resources.filter(
    (resource, index) => permitted[index]
);
```

---
### Set Timeout
For setting the timeout for the bulk check, you can set the 'PDP_OPA_CLIENT_QUERY_TIMEOUT' environment variable for the PDP.

If for example you want a 10 second timeout, you can set the environment variable as follows:

```bash
PDP_OPA_CLIENT_QUERY_TIMEOUT=10
```
OPA Runs the authorization query concurrently based on the amount of CPU it has, so if you have a lot of queries to run, you can increase the CPU count to speed up the process.

:::note
While `bulkCheck` will save you time in latency, it could have an impact on performance if you're checking permissions for different tenants.
This is because requests are split by tenant in order to reach the relevant PDP instances. This is done in order to ensure compatibility with the current [PDP Sharding](/how-to/manage-data/pdp-sharding) setup, in which an instance might only contain data for a few tenants.
