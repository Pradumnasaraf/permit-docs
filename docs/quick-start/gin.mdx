In this guide, we will quickly go through the steps to integrate Permit.io with Gin. We will use Permit's CLI to create a new environment and a policy with a template. Then, we will use the Permit SDK to integrate it with our Gin application. We will also set up the PDP (Policy Decision Point) server locally using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Gin (Go) application
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the PDP server)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for installing and running the Permit CLI)
- [Permit.io](https://permit.io) account (Follow [this](/quickstart) guide to create an account)

<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Permit CLI

We will first install the [Permit CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli). Permit CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create policies, run the PDP server, and perform other tasks. To install the CLI, execute the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @permitio/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, execute `permit` to confirm the installation. 

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Authenticating the CLI

To use the CLI, we need to authenticate it with our Permit account. To authenticate, execute 

```bash
permit login
```

This will open a browser window and ask you to log in with your Permit account. After logging in, the CLI will be authenticated and ready to use. This will also log you into the default environment (a project can have multiple environments). 

We can change the environment by executing `permit env select` and then selecting the environment we want to use.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a policy with a template

Permit CLI offers various templates to create a policy with predefined roles and resources using best practices. This will save us time and effort in creating a policy from scratch.

To check the available templates, execute `permit template list`. Also, you can head over to the [Permit CLI repo](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/tree/main/source/templates) to see the templates and the actual terraform code for each template.

![permit template list](/img/quick-start-guide/permit-template-list.png)

We will be using the **blogging-platform** template to create the policy. This template will help us setting up a policy for a blogging platform with roles and resources. The policy is explained in detail below in the next step.

To apply the template, execute the command below.

```bash
permit template apply --template blogging-platform
```

You will see a successful message in the terminal.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Understanding and accessing the policy from the dashboard

Now, head over to the Permit's dashboard and select the project and click on the **Policy** tab from the left sidebar. You will see the policy we just created.

![permit policy](/img/quick-start-guide/policy-editor-dash.png)

This policy defines access control for a blogging platform, here is breakdown of the policy: 
- **Posts** and **Comments** are the resources.
- Users are assigned roles like **Author**, **Moderator**, or **Reader**, with permissions scoped to each resource.
- A `premium` attribute on posts enables ABAC, restricting access to premium content.
- Through a **Postâ€“Comment** relationship, **Post Authors** automatically become **Comment Moderators**.
- A **Free Post** resource set filters non-premium posts, allowing **Readers** to access only free content.
The setup combines ABAC and ReBAC to enforce flexible and secure permissions.

It's quite easy to add and remove the permissions by checking and unchecking the permissions in the policy editor.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Getting the API key

To get the API key:

1. Click on **Projects** from the left sidebar.
2. Click on the three dots on the environment we want to use.
3. Click on **Copy API Key** and store it in a safe place. We will be using this API key to authenticate our application with Permit.io. If you are having any difficulty getting the API key, follow this [guide](/overview/connecting-your-app/#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

Once we are done, let's move toward the implementation part and integrate Permit.io with our Gin application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Golang SDK

Once you have a Gin application ready (or you can create a new one for the sake of this guide), we can integrate Permit.io with it. First, we need to install the Permit's Golang SDK. To install the SDK, execute the below command in your terminal.

```bash
go get github.com/permitio/permit-golang
```

Read more about the Golang SDK [here](/sdk/golang/quickstart-golang).

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the Gin application

Below is a sample implementation of the Permit SDK in a Gin application. We will understand each part of the code in detail below.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/config"
	"github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/enforcement"
	"github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/models"
	"github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/permit"
	"go.uber.org/zap"
)

var permitClient *permit.Client

type UserIn struct {
	Email     string `json:"email" binding:"required,email"`
	FirstName string `json:"first_name" binding:"required"`
	LastName  string `json:"last_name" binding:"required"`
}

type TenantIn struct {
	Key         string  `json:"key" binding:"required"`
	Name        string  `json:"name" binding:"required"`
	Description *string `json:"description"` // Optional
}

type PermissionCheck struct {
	User     string `json:"user" binding:"required"`
	Action   string `json:"action" binding:"required"`
	Resource string `json:"resource" binding:"required"`
}
```

We created a `permitClient` instance to interact with the Permit API. `UserIn`, `TenantIn`, and `PermissionCheck` structs are used to bind the incoming JSON request.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Defining the routes

Let's initialize the Permit SDK and create routes for the application.

```go
func main() {

	apiKey := os.Getenv("PERMIT_API_KEY")
	pdpURL := os.Getenv("PDP_URL")

	permitClient = permit.NewPermit(
		config.NewConfigBuilder(apiKey).
			WithLogger(zap.NewExample()).
			WithPdpUrl(pdpURL).
			Build(),
	)

	router := gin.Default()

	router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"message": "Hello, Gin with Permit!"})
	})

	router.POST("/sync-user", syncUserHandler)
	router.POST("/create-tenant", createTenantHandler)

	// Add a protected route using the middleware
	router.POST("/check-permission", PermissionMiddleware(), func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"message": "You have access to the protected resource!"})
	})

	log.Println("Server running on http://localhost:8000")
	router.Run(":8000")
}
```

We have created a Permit client instance and initialized it which requires two environment variables `PERMIT_API_KEY` is the API key we copied from the Permit dashboard, and the `PDP_URL` is the URL of the PDP server. We will set this up later.

Then we have created a new Gin router and defined the routes. We have defined three routes, `/sync-user`, `/create-tenant`, and `/check-permission` which calls the respective handlers. We have also added a middleware to the `/check-permission` route to check the access.

### Defining the handlers

Let's define the handlers for the routes.

```go
func syncUserHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	var user UserIn
	if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&user); err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
		return
	}

	createUser := models.NewUserCreate(user.Email)
	createUser.SetFirstName(user.FirstName)
	createUser.SetLastName(user.LastName)
	createUser.SetEmail(user.Email)

	newUser, err := permitClient.Api.Users.SyncUser(context.Background(), *createUser)
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Failed to sync user"})
		return
	}
	if newUser == nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "User not found"})
		return
	} else {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, newUser)
		return
	}
}

func createTenantHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	var tenant TenantIn
	if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&tenant); err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
		return
	}
	createTenant := models.NewTenantCreate(tenant.Key, tenant.Name)
	createTenant.Description = tenant.Description
	createTenant.SetName(tenant.Name)

	newTenant, err := permitClient.Api.Tenants.Create(context.Background(), *createTenant)

	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Failed to create tenant"})
		return
	}
	if newTenant == nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Tenant not found"})
		return
	} else {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, newTenant)
		return
	}
}

```

- `syncUserHandler` is used to sync the user with Permit.io. If user is not found, it will create a new user.
- `createTenantHandler` is used to create a new tenant with Permit.io. If tenant is not found, it will create a new tenant.

### Defining the middleware

To check the access, we will use the middleware approach. Let's define the middleware for the application.

```go
// Middleware for permission check
func PermissionMiddleware() gin.HandlerFunc {
	return func(c *gin.Context) {
		user := c.GetHeader("X-User")
		action := c.GetHeader("X-Action")
		resource := c.GetHeader("X-Resource")

		if user == "" || action == "" || resource == "" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": "Missing permission headers: X-User, X-Action, X-Resource"})
			c.Abort()
			return
		}

		enfUser := enforcement.UserBuilder(user).Build()
		enfResource := enforcement.ResourceBuilder(resource).Build()

		permitted, err := permitClient.Check(enfUser, enforcement.Action(action), enfResource)
		if err != nil {
			c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Permission check failed"})
			c.Abort()
			return
		}
		if !permitted {
			c.JSON(http.StatusForbidden, gin.H{"message": "User is not permitted"})
			c.Abort()
			return
		}
		c.Next()
	}
}
```

We have created a middleware function that checks the access to a specific resource. It is very easy to add middleware to any route we want to protect.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the PDP server

Now, our application is ready by syncing the user and having a policy created. Let's enforce and check the policy. To enforce the policy, we use [Permit's PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview) (Policy Decision Point) to check if the user has access to the resource. So first, let's set up the PDP.

By running the following command, Permit CLI will spin up our environment PDP in a docker container.

```bash
permit pdp run
```

Once we execute the above command, you will see an output like the one below, with information such as container ID, name, etc.

![permit pdp run](/img/quick-start-guide/create-pdp.png)

The PDP server will be running on port `7766` by default. We can also change the port. Finally, update the `PDP_URL` environment variable in your application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Syncing the user

Now, everything is ready, let's restart and test the application and test the `/sync-user` endpoint using `curl`.

![curl create user](/img/quick-start-guide/gin-sync-user.png)

As we can see in the above image, the user is created successfully and we get a lot of information about the user in the response like, `id`, `project_id`, `key`, etc.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Giving the user access to the resource

Now that we have created a user, let's give this user access to the resource we created in the policy. To do that:
1. Select **Directory** from the left sidebar in Permit's dashboard.
2. Click **Add Role** button.
3. Select tenant **(default)** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Author** role and save it.

We will verify this later when we check the access.

![user access](/img/quick-start-guide/user-access.png)

We can also add more roles and resources as per our needs. Now, let's set up the PDP server and check the access.

:::info
We can give the access programmatically, it was a demo to show how easy it is to add access using the dashboard.
:::

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Checking the access

Now, let's check the policy enforcement. As we have added the user to the **Author** role, we can check if the user has **create** access to the **Post** resource. To do that, we will use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/check-permission` endpoint.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/gin-user-permitted.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is permitted to access the resource. Let's remove the access from the dashboard and check again. 

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/gin-user-not-permitted.png)

Now this time we can see that the user is not permitted to access the resource. This is how we can enforce policies using Permit.io with Gin.

</TimelineStep>

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have seen how to integrate Permit.io with Gin application. We have created a new policy with a template using the Permit CLI. We have also seen how to sync users and create tenants with Permit.io. We have also set up the PDP server locally using Docker and checked the access using the `/check-permission` route. This is how easy it is to integrate Permit.io with Gin application and enforce policies.
