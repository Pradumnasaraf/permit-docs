In this guide, we will quickly go through the steps to integrate Permit.io with Next.js. We will use Permit's CLI to create a new environment and a policy with a template. Then, we will use the Permit SDK to integrate it with our Next.js application. We will also set up the PDP (Policy Decision Point) server locally using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Next.js application  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the PDP server)  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for installing and running the Permit CLI)  
- [Permit.io](https://permit.io) account (Follow [this](/quickstart) guide to create an account)

<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Permit CLI

We will first install the [Permit CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli). Permit CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create policies, run the PDP server, and perform other tasks. To install the CLI, execute the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @permitio/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, execute `permit` to confirm the installation. 

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Authenticating the CLI

To use the CLI, we need to authenticate it with our Permit account. To authenticate, execute 

```bash
permit login
```

This will open a browser window and ask you to log in with your Permit account. After logging in, the CLI will be authenticated and ready to use. This will also log you into the default environment (a project can have multiple environments). 

We can change the environment by executing `permit env select` and then selecting the environment we want to use.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a policy with a template

Permit CLI offers various templates to create a policy with predefined roles and resources using best practices. This will save us time and effort in creating a policy from scratch.

To check the available templates, execute `permit template list`. Also, you can head over to the [Permit CLI repo](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/tree/main/source/templates) to see the templates and the actual terraform code for each template.

![permit template list](/img/quick-start-guide/permit-template-list.png)

We will be using the **blogging-platform** template to create the policy. This template will help us setting up a policy for a blogging platform with roles and resources. The policy is explained in detail below in the next step.

To apply the template, execute the command below.

```bash
permit template apply --template blogging-platform
```

You will see a successful message in the terminal.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Understanding and accessing the policy from the dashboard

Now, head over to the Permit's dashboard and select the project and click on the **Policy** tab from the left sidebar. You will see the policy we just created.

![permit policy](/img/quick-start-guide/policy-editor-dash.png)

This policy defines access control for a blogging platform, here is breakdown of the policy: 
- **Posts** and **Comments** are the resources.
- Users are assigned roles like **Author**, **Moderator**, or **Reader**, with permissions scoped to each resource.
- A `premium` attribute on posts enables ABAC, restricting access to premium content.
- Through a **Postâ€“Comment** relationship, **Post Authors** automatically become **Comment Moderators**.
- A **Free Post** resource set filters non-premium posts, allowing **Readers** to access only free content.
The setup combines ABAC and ReBAC to enforce flexible and secure permissions.

It's quite easy to add and remove the permissions by checking and unchecking the permissions in the policy editor.

### Getting the API key

To get the API key:

1. Click on **Projects** from the left sidebar.
2. Click on the three dots on the environment we want to use.
3. Click on **Copy API Key** and store it in a safe place. We will be using this API key to authenticate our application with Permit.io. If you are having any difficulty getting the API key, follow this [guide](/overview/connecting-your-app/#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Next.js SDK

Once you have a Next.js application ready (or you can create a new one for the sake of this guide), we can integrate Permit.io with it. First, we need to install the Permit's Next.js SDK. To install the SDK, execute the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npm install permitio
```

Read more about the Next.js SDK [here](/sdk/nextjs/quickstart-nextjs).

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the Next.js application with Permit.io

Let's start by creating a Permit helper file. This file will be used to initialize the Permit SDK and export the instance. Create a new file called `permit.ts` under the `src/lib` folder (may vary depending on your project structure) and add the following code.

```javascript
import { Permit } from "permitio";

export const permit = new Permit({
  token: process.env.PERMIT_API_KEY!,
  pdp: process.env.PDP_URL!,
});
```

It needs two environment variables `PERMIT_API_KEY` is the API key we copied from the Permit dashboard, and the `PDP_URL` is the URL of the PDP server. We will set this up later.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating API routes 

Let's create API routes for syncing users. Create a file named `route.ts` under the `src/app/api/sync-user` folder and add the following code.

```javascript
import { permit } from '@/lib/permit';
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { email, first_name, last_name } = await req.json();

  if (!email || !first_name || !last_name) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing required fields' }), { status: 400 });
  }

  try {
    const user = await permit.api.users.sync({
      key: email,
      email,
      first_name,
      last_name,
    });
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(user), { status: 201 });
  } catch (err) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to sync user' }), { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

Now, let's create another file called `create-tenant.ts` under the `src/app/api/create-tenant` folder and add the following code.

```javascript
import { permit } from '@/lib/permit';
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { key, name, description } = await req.json();

  if (!key || !name) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing key or name' }), { status: 400 });
  }

  try {
    const tenant = await permit.api.tenants.create({
      key,
      name,
      description,
    });
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(tenant), { status: 201 });
  } catch (err) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to create tenant' }), { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

- `sync-user.ts` is used to sync the user with Permit.io. It will create a new user if the user does not exist; otherwise, it will update the existing user.
- `create-tenant.ts` is used to create a new tenant with Permit.io. It will create a new tenant if the tenant does not exist; otherwise, it will update the existing tenant.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating middleware for policy enforcement

To handle the policy enforcement, we will use middleware. Middleware is a function that runs before the request is handled by the server. It can be used to check if the user has access to the resource. 

Create a new file called `middleware.ts` under the `src/middleware` folder and add the following code.

```javascript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { Permit } from 'permitio';

const permit = new Permit({
  token: process.env.PERMIT_API_KEY!,
  pdp: process.env.PDP_URL!,
});

export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  // Only run for /api/protected/* routes
  if (!req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/protected/')) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }

  const user = req.headers.get('x-user');
  const action = req.headers.get('x-action');
  const resource = req.headers.get('x-resource');

  if (!user || !action || !resource) {
    return new NextResponse(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing permission info' }), { status: 400 });
  }

  try {
    const permitted = await permit.check(user, action, resource);
    if (!permitted) {
      return new NextResponse(JSON.stringify({ message: 'User is not permitted' }), { status: 403 });
    }
    return NextResponse.next();
  } catch (err) {
    return new NextResponse(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Permission check failed' }), { status: 500 });
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/api/protected/:path*'],
};
```

To see if all the above code is working fine, let's create a simple API route to test the middleware. Create a new file called `route.ts` under `src/app/api/protected/secret.ts` folder and add the following code.

```javascript
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ secret: "You have pass the auth check" }),
    { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } }
  );
}
```

This is a simple API route that will return a secret message if the user is permitted to access the resource. We will use this route to test the middleware.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the PDP server

Now, our application is ready by syncing the user and having a policy created. Let's enforce and check the policy. To enforce the policy, we use [Permit's PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview) (Policy Decision Point) to check if the user has access to the resource. So first, let's set up the PDP.

By running the following command, Permit CLI will spin up our environment PDP in a docker container.

```bash
permit pdp run
```

Once we execute the above command, you will see an output like the one below, with information such as container ID, name, etc.

![permit pdp run](/img/quick-start-guide/create-pdp.png)

The PDP server will be running on port `7766` by default. We can also change the port. Finally, update the `PDP_URL` environment variable in your application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Syncing the user

Now, we have everything ready. Let's run the application and do `curl` requests to test the endpoint for the sync user route.

![curl create user](/img/quick-start-guide/next-sync-user.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is created successfully and we get a lot of information about the user in the response, such as `id`, `project_id`, `key`, etc.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Giving the user access to the resource

Now that we have created a user, let's give this user access to the resource we created in the policy. To do that:
1. Select **Directory** from the left sidebar in Permit's dashboard.
2. Click **Add Role** button.
3. Select tenant **(default)** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Author** role and save it.

We will verify this later when we check the access.

![user access](/img/quick-start-guide/user-access.png)

We can also add more roles and resources as per our needs. Now, let's set up the PDP server and check the access.

:::info
We can give the access programmatically, it was a demo to show how easy it is to add access using the dashboard.
:::

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Checking the access

Now, let's check the policy enforcement. As we have added the user to the **Author** role, we can check if the user has **create** access to the **Post** resource. To do that, we will use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/api/protected/secret` endpoint.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/next-user-permitted.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is permitted to access the resource. Let's remove the access from the dashboard and check again.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/next-user-not-permitted.png)

Now this time, we can see that the user is not permitted to access the resource. This is how we can enforce policies using Permit.io with Next.js.

</TimelineStep>

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have seen how to integrate Permit.io with Next.js. We have created a policy with a template using the Permit CLI. We have also seen how to sync users and tenants, assigning roles easily with the Permit Dashboard. Finally, we have enforced policies using the Permit SDK in our Next.js application.
