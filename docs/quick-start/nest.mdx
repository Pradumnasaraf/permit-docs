In this guide, we will quickly go through the steps to integrate Permit.io with NestJS. We will use Permit's CLI to create a new environment and a policy with a template. Then, we will use the Permit SDK to integrate it with our NestJS application. We will also set up the PDP (Policy Decision Point) server locally using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- NestJS application
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the PDP server)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for installing and running the Permit CLI)  
- [Permit.io](https://permit.io) account (Follow [this](/quickstart) guide to create an account)

<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Permit CLI

We will first install the [Permit CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli). Permit CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create policies, run the PDP server, and perform other tasks. To install the CLI, execute the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @permitio/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, execute `permit` to confirm the installation. 

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Authenticating the CLI

To use the CLI, we need to authenticate it with our Permit account. To authenticate, execute 

```bash
permit login
```

This will open a browser window and ask you to log in with your Permit account. After logging in, the CLI will be authenticated and ready to use. This will also log you into the default environment (a project can have multiple environments). 

We can change the environment by executing `permit env select` and then selecting the environment we want to use.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a policy with a template

Permit CLI offers various templates to create a policy with predefined roles and resources using best practices. This will save us time and effort in creating a policy from scratch.

To check the available templates, execute `permit template list`. Also, you can head over to the [Permit CLI repo](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/tree/main/source/templates) to see the templates and the actual terraform code for each template.

![permit template list](/img/quick-start-guide/permit-template-list.png)

We will be using the **blogging-platform** template to create the policy. This template will help us setting up a policy for a blogging platform with roles and resources. The policy is explained in detail below in the next step.

To apply the template, execute the command below.

```bash
permit template apply --template blogging-platform
```

You will see a successful message in the terminal.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Understanding and accessing the policy from the dashboard

Now, head over to the Permit's dashboard and select the project and click on the **Policy** tab from the left sidebar. You will see the policy we just created.

![permit policy](/img/quick-start-guide/policy-editor-dash.png)

This policy defines access control for a blogging platform, here is breakdown of the policy: 
- **Posts** and **Comments** are the resources.
- Users are assigned roles like **Author**, **Moderator**, or **Reader**, with permissions scoped to each resource.
- A `premium` attribute on posts enables ABAC, restricting access to premium content.
- Through a **Postâ€“Comment** relationship, **Post Authors** automatically become **Comment Moderators**.
- A **Free Post** resource set filters non-premium posts, allowing **Readers** to access only free content.
The setup combines ABAC and ReBAC to enforce flexible and secure permissions.

It's quite easy to add and remove the permissions by checking and unchecking the permissions in the policy editor.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Getting the API key

To get the API key:

1. Click on **Projects** from the left sidebar.
2. Click on the three dots on the environment we want to use.
3. Click on **Copy API Key** and store it in a safe place. We will be using this API key to authenticate our application with Permit.io. If you are having any difficulty getting the API key, follow this [guide](/overview/connecting-your-app/#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

Once we are done, let's move toward the implementation part and integrate Permit.io with our NestJS application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing Node.js SDK

Once you have a NestJS application ready (or you can create a new one for the sake of this guide), we can integrate Permit.io with it. First, we need to install the Permit's Node.js SDK. To install the SDK, execute the below command in your terminal.

```bash
npm install permitio
```

Read more about the Node.js SDK [here](/sdk/nodejs/quickstart-nodejs).

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the NestJS application with Permit.io

Once the installation is complete, now let's create a Permit provider. Create a new file `permit.provider.ts` in the `src/permit` directory (it may vary depending on your project structure) and add the following code.

```typescript
// src/permit/permit.provider.ts
import { Permit } from 'permitio';

export const permit = new Permit({
  token: process.env.PERMIT_API_KEY!,
  pdp: process.env.PDP_URL!,
});
```

Here, we are importing the `Permit` class from the `permitio` package and creating a new instance. It requires two environment variables `PERMIT_API_KEY` that is the API key we copied from the Permit dashboard, and the `PDP_URL` is the URL of the PDP server. We will set this up later.

</TimelineStep> 
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the endpoints

Now, we will create two endpoints for syncing users and creating tenants. Create a new file `app.controller.ts` in the `src` directory and add the following code. Also, create a guard to protect our endpoints.

```typescript
// src/app.controller.ts
import { Controller, Post, Body, HttpException, HttpStatus, UseGuards, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { permit } from './permit/permit.provider';
import { PermitGuard } from './permit/permit.guard';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Post('sync-user')
  async syncUser(@Body() body: { email: string, first_name: string, last_name: string }) {
    const { email, first_name, last_name } = body;
    if (!email || !first_name || !last_name) {
      throw new HttpException('Missing required fields', HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
    try {
      const user = await permit.api.users.sync({
        key: email,
        email,
        first_name,
        last_name,
      });
      return user;
    } catch (err) {
      throw new HttpException('Failed to sync user', HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
  }

  @Post('create-tenant')
  async createTenant(@Body() body: { key: string, name: string, description?: string }) {
    const { key, name, description } = body;
    if (!key || !name) {
      throw new HttpException('Missing key or name', HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
    try {
      const tenant = await permit.api.tenants.create({
        key,
        name,
        description,
      });
      return tenant;
    } catch (err) {
      throw new HttpException('Failed to create tenant', HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
  }

  @UseGuards(PermitGuard)
  @Get('protected/secret')
  getSecret() {
    return { secret: "You have pass the auth check" };
  }
}
```

- The `syncUser` endpoint will sync the user with Permit.io. We are using the `sync` method to sync the user with Permit.io.

- The `createTenant` endpoint will create a tenant with Permit.io. We are using the `create` method to create the tenant.

- The `getSecret` endpoint will return a secret message. We are using the `getSecret` method to return the secret message. This endpoint is protected, just like a middleware in other frameworks.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the guard

Next, we will create a guard to protect our endpoints. It's similar to middleware in NestJS. Create a new file `permit.guard.ts` in the `src/permit` directory and add the following code.

```typescript
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable, HttpException, HttpStatus } from '@nestjs/common';
import { permit } from './permit.provider';

@Injectable()
export class PermitGuard implements CanActivate {
  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.headers['x-user'];
    const action = request.headers['x-action'];
    const resource = request.headers['x-resource'];

    if (!user || !action || !resource) {
      throw new HttpException('Missing permission info', HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }

    try {
      const permitted = await permit.check(user, action, resource);
      return permitted;
    } catch (err) {
      throw new HttpException('Permission check failed', HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
  }
} 
```

`PermitGuard` is a guard that checks if the user has access to the resource. . The `canActivate` method is called before the request is handled. It checks if the user has access to the resource.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the PDP server

Now, our application is ready by syncing the user and having a policy created. Let's enforce and check the policy. To enforce the policy, we use [Permit's PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview) (Policy Decision Point) to check if the user has access to the resource. So first, let's set up the PDP.

By running the following command, Permit CLI will spin up our environment PDP in a docker container.

```bash
permit pdp run
```

Once we execute the above command, you will see an output like the one below, with information such as container ID, name, etc.

![permit pdp run](/img/quick-start-guide/create-pdp.png)

The PDP server will be running on port `7766` by default. We can also change the port. Finally, update the `PDP_URL` environment variable in your application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Syncing the user

Now, we have everything ready. Let's run the application and do `curl` requests to test the endpoint for the sync user route.

![curl create user](/img/quick-start-guide/nest-sync-user.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is created successfully and we get a lot of information about the user in the response, such as `id`, `project_id`, `key`, etc.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Giving the user access to the resource

Now that we have created a user, let's give this user access to the resource we created in the policy. To do that:
1. Select **Directory** from the left sidebar in Permit's dashboard.
2. Click **Add Role** button.
3. Select tenant **(default)** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Author** role and save it.

We will verify this later when we check the access.

![user access](/img/quick-start-guide/user-access.png)

We can also add more roles and resources as per our needs. Now, let's set up the PDP server and check the access.

:::info
We can give the access programmatically, it was a demo to show how easy it is to add access using the dashboard.
:::

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Checking the access

Now, let's check the policy enforcement. As we have added the user to the **Author** role, we can check if the user has **create** access to the **Post** resource. To do that, we will use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/protected/secret` endpoint. 

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/nest-user-permitted.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is permitted to access the resource. Let's remove the access from the dashboard and check again.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/nest-user-not-permitted.png)

Now this time, we can see that the user is not permitted to access the resource. This is how we can enforce policies using Permit.io with NestJS.
