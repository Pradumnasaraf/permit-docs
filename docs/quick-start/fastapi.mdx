In this guide, we will quickly go through the steps to integrate Permit.io with FastAPI. We will use Permit's CLI to create a new environment and a policy with a template. Then, we will use the Permit SDK to integrate it with our FastAPI application. We will also set up the PDP (Policy Decision Point) server locally using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- FastAPI application
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the PDP server)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for installing and running the Permit CLI)
- [Permit.io](https://permit.io) account (Follow [this](/quickstart) guide to create an account)

<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Permit CLI

We will first install the [Permit CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli). Permit CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create policies, run the PDP server, and perform other tasks. To install the CLI, execute the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @permitio/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, execute `permit` to confirm the installation. 

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Authenticating the CLI

To use the CLI, we need to authenticate it with our Permit account. To authenticate, execute 

```bash
permit login
```

This will open a browser window and ask you to log in with your Permit account. After logging in, the CLI will be authenticated and ready to use. This will also log you into the default environment (a project can have multiple environments). 

We can change the environment by executing `permit env select` and then selecting the environment we want to use.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a policy with a template

Permit CLI offers various templates to create a policy with predefined roles and resources using best practices. This will save us time and effort in creating a policy from scratch.

To check the available templates, execute `permit template list`. Also, you can head over to the [Permit CLI repo](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/tree/main/source/templates) to see the templates and the actual terraform code for each template.

![permit template list](/img/quick-start-guide/permit-template-list.png)

We will be using the **blogging-platform** template to create the policy. This template will help us setting up a policy for a blogging platform with roles and resources. The policy is explained in detail below in the next step.

To apply the template, execute the command below.

```bash
permit template apply --template blogging-platform
```

You will see a successful message in the terminal.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Understanding and accessing the policy from the dashboard

Now, head over to the Permit's dashboard and select the project and click on the **Policy** tab from the left sidebar. You will see the policy we just created.

![permit policy](/img/quick-start-guide/policy-editor-dash.png)

This policy defines access control for a blogging platform, here is breakdown of the policy: 
- **Posts** and **Comments** are the resources.
- Users are assigned roles like **Author**, **Moderator**, or **Reader**, with permissions scoped to each resource.
- A `premium` attribute on posts enables ABAC, restricting access to premium content.
- Through a **Postâ€“Comment** relationship, **Post Authors** automatically become **Comment Moderators**.
- A **Free Post** resource set filters non-premium posts, allowing **Readers** to access only free content.
The setup combines ABAC and ReBAC to enforce flexible and secure permissions.

It's quite easy to add and remove the permissions by checking and unchecking the permissions in the policy editor.

</TimelineStep>

### Getting the API key

To get the API key:

1. Click on **Projects** from the left sidebar.
2. Click on the three dots on the environment we want to use.
3. Click on **Copy API Key** and store it in a safe place. We will be using this API key to authenticate our application with Permit.io. If you are having any difficulty getting the API key, follow this [guide](/overview/connecting-your-app/#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

Once we are done, let's move toward the implementation part and integrate Permit.io with our FastAPI application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing Python SDK

Once you have a FastAPI application is ready (or you can create a new one for the sake of this guide), we will install the Permit's Python SDK. 

To install the Permit SDK, execute the below command in your terminal.

```bash
pip install permit
```

Read more about the Python SDK [here](/sdk/python/quickstart_python_sync).

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the FastAPI application with Permit.io

Let's start by setting up the FastAPI application. We will create a new file called `main.py` and add the following code to it.

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, status
from permit import Permit
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr 
import os

app = FastAPI()

class UserIn(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    first_name: str
    last_name: str

class TenantIn(BaseModel):
    key: str
    name: str
    description: str = None # Optional field

# Initialize Permit SDK
permit = Permit(
    token=os.getenv("PERMIT_API_KEY"),
    pdp=os.getenv("PDP_URL", ""),  # Update if your PDP URL differs
)
```

We have defined two models `UserIn` and `TenantIn` to validate the request body. We are using Pydantic to validate the request body and return errors if any.

Permit SDK is initialized with the required two environment variables `PERMIT_API_KEY` that is the API key we copied from the Permit dashboard, and the `PDP_URL` is the URL of the PDP server. We will set this up later.


</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating endpoints

Now, let's create the endpoints for the FastAPI application: 

```python
@app.post("/sync-user", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def sync_user(user_in: UserIn):
    user = await permit.api.users.sync(
        {
            "key": user_in.email,
            "email": user_in.email,
            "first_name": user_in.first_name,
            "last_name": user_in.last_name,
        }
    )
    return user

# Create tenant with Permit.io
@app.post("/create-tenant", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def create_tenant(tenant_in: TenantIn):
    tenant = await permit.api.tenants.create(
        {
            "key": tenant_in.key,
            "name": tenant_in.name,
            "description": tenant_in.description,
        }
    )
    return tenant
```

- The `sync_user` endpoint which will sync the user with Permit.io. We are using the `sync` method to sync the user with Permit.io. The `sync` method takes a dictionary with the user details and returns a response. 
- The `create_tenant` endpoint which will create a tenant with Permit.io. We are using the `create` method to create the tenant. The `create` method takes a dictionary with the tenant details and returns a response.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Syncing the user

Once we are done with the code, let's run the FastAPI application and test the `/sync-user` endpoint using `curl`.

![curl create user](/img/quick-start-guide/python-sync-user.png)

As we can see in the above image, the user is created successfully and we get a lot of information about the user in the response like, `id`, `project_id`, `key`, etc.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Giving the user access to the resource

Now that we have created a user, let's give this user access to the resource we created in the policy. To do that:
1. Select **Directory** from the left sidebar in Permit's dashboard.
2. Click **Add Role** button.
3. Select tenant **(default)** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Author** role and save it.

We will verify this later when we check the access.

![user access](/img/quick-start-guide/user-access.png)

We can also add more roles and resources as per our needs. Now, let's set up the PDP server and check the access.

:::info
We can give the access programmatically, it was a demo to show how easy it is to add access using the dashboard.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the PDP server

Now, our application is ready by syncing the user and having a policy created. Let's enforce and check the policy. To enforce the policy, we use [Permit's PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview) (Policy Decision Point) to check if the user has access to the resource. So first, let's set up the PDP.

By running the following command, Permit CLI will spin up our environment PDP in a docker container.

```bash
permit pdp run
```

Once we execute the above command, you will see an output like the one below, with information such as container ID, name, etc.

![permit pdp run](/img/quick-start-guide/create-pdp.png)

The PDP server will be running on port `7766` by default. We can also change the port. Finally, update the `PDP_URL` environment variable in your application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating the new endpoint to check the access

To check the access, we will create a new endpoint `/check-permission` and `PermissionCheck` model in our application. This endpoint will check if the user has access to the resource. We need to modify the existing code to add the new endpoint.

```python
# PermissionCheck model
class PermissionCheck(BaseModel):
    user: str
    action: str
    resource: str
```

```python
# /check-permission endpoint
@app.post("/check-permission")
async def check_permission(data: PermissionCheck):
    permitted = await permit.check(data.user, data.action, data.resource)
    if permitted:
        return {"message": "User is permitted"}
    else:
        return {"message": "User is not permitted"}, status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
```

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Checking the access

Now, let's check the policy enforcement. As we have added the user to the **Author** role, we can check if the user has **create** access to the **Post** resource. To do that, we will use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/check-permission` endpoint.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/python-user-permitted.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is permitted to access the resource. To check it works the other way around, let's remove the access from the dashboard and check again.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/python-user-not-permitted.png)

Now this time we can see that the user is not permitted to access the resource. This is how we can enforce policies using Permit.io with FastAPI.

</TimelineStep>

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have seen how to integrate Permit.io with FastAPI. We have created a policy with a template using the Permit CLI. We have also seen how to sync users and create tenants with Permit.io. Finally, we have checked the access using the PDP server. This is how easy it is to integrate Permit.io with FastAPI. You can use the same approach to integrate Permit.io with other frameworks as well.
