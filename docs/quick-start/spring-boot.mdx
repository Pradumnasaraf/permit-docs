In this guide, we will quickly go through the steps to integrate Permit.io with Spring Boot. We will use Permit's CLI to create a new environment and a policy with a template. Then, we will use the Permit SDK to integrate it with our Spring Boot application. We will also set up the PDP (Policy Decision Point) server locally using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Spring Boot application
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the PDP server)  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for installing and running the Permit CLI)  
- [Permit.io](https://permit.io) account (Follow [this](/quickstart) guide to create an account)

<TimelineWrapper>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Permit CLI

We will first install the [Permit CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli). Permit CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create policies, run the PDP server, and perform other tasks. To install the CLI, execute the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @permitio/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, execute `permit` to confirm the installation. 

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Authenticating the CLI

To use the CLI, we need to authenticate it with our Permit account. To authenticate, execute 

```bash
permit login
```

This will open a browser window and ask you to log in with your Permit account. After logging in, the CLI will be authenticated and ready to use. This will also log you into the default environment (a project can have multiple environments). 

We can change the environment by executing `permit env select` and then selecting the environment we want to use.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a policy with a template

Permit CLI offers various templates to create a policy with predefined roles and resources using best practices. This will save us time and effort in creating a policy from scratch.

To check the available templates, execute `permit template list`. Also, you can head over to the [Permit CLI repo](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/tree/main/source/templates) to see the templates and the actual terraform code for each template.

![permit template list](/img/quick-start-guide/permit-template-list.png)

We will be using the **blogging-platform** template to create the policy. This template will help us setting up a policy for a blogging platform with roles and resources. The policy is explained in detail below in the next step.

To apply the template, execute the command below.

```bash
permit template apply --template blogging-platform
```

You will see a successful message in the terminal.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Understanding and accessing the policy from the dashboard

Now, head over to the Permit's dashboard and select the project and click on the **Policy** tab from the left sidebar. You will see the policy we just created.

![permit policy](/img/quick-start-guide/policy-editor-dash.png)

This policy defines access control for a blogging platform, here is breakdown of the policy: 
- **Posts** and **Comments** are the resources.
- Users are assigned roles like **Author**, **Moderator**, or **Reader**, with permissions scoped to each resource.
- A `premium` attribute on posts enables ABAC, restricting access to premium content.
- Through a **Postâ€“Comment** relationship, **Post Authors** automatically become **Comment Moderators**.
- A **Free Post** resource set filters non-premium posts, allowing **Readers** to access only free content.
The setup combines ABAC and ReBAC to enforce flexible and secure permissions.

It's quite easy to add and remove the permissions by checking and unchecking the permissions in the policy editor.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Getting the API key

To get the API key:

1. Click on **Projects** from the left sidebar.
2. Click on the three dots on the environment we want to use.
3. Click on **Copy API Key** and store it in a safe place. We will be using this API key to authenticate our application with Permit.io. If you are having any difficulty getting the API key, follow this [guide](/overview/connecting-your-app/#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

Once we are done, let's move toward the implementation part and integrate Permit.io with our application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Java SDK

Once you have a Spring Boot application ready (or you can create a new one for the sake of this guide), we can start integrating Permit.io with it. Add Permit's dependency to your `pom.xml` file (it may vary depending on your project setup).

Read more about the Java SDK [here](/sdk/java/quickstart-java).

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.permit</groupId>
  <artifactId>permit-sdk-java</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Then install the dependency by `mvn clean install`.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the Spring Boot application

Let's start by creating a new Spring Boot application. We will create a new file called `PermitdemoApplication.java` and add the following code to it.

```java
package com.example.permitdemo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class PermitdemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PermitdemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the Permit controller

Let's create a `PermitController` class to handle the requests.

```java
package com.example.permitdemo;

import io.permit.sdk.Permit;
import io.permit.sdk.PermitConfig;
import io.permit.sdk.api.PermitApiError;
import io.permit.sdk.api.PermitContextError;
import io.permit.sdk.enforcement.Resource;
import io.permit.sdk.enforcement.User;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.UserRead;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.UserCreate;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.TenantCreate;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.TenantRead;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Map;

@RestController
public class PermitController {

    private final Permit permit;

    public PermitController(
            @Value("${PERMIT_API_KEY}") String apiKey,
            @Value("${PDP_URL}") String pdpUrl
    ) {
        this.permit = new Permit(
                new PermitConfig.Builder(apiKey)
                        .withPdpAddress(pdpUrl)
                        .withDebugMode(true)
                        .build()
        );
    }
}
```

We have defined a `PermitController` class and the constructor initializes the Permit SDK. It needs two environment variables `PERMIT_API_KEY` is the API key we copied from the Permit dashboard, and the `PDP_URL` is the URL of the PDP server. We will set this up later.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Defining the endpoints

Inside the `PermitController` class, we will define three endpoints for the controller.

```java
    // Sync a user
    @PostMapping("/sync-user")
    public ResponseEntity<?> syncUser(@RequestBody Map<String, String> body) {
        String email = body.get("email");
        String firstName = body.get("first_name");
        String lastName = body.get("last_name");

        if (email == null || firstName == null || lastName == null) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(Map.of("error", "Missing required fields"));
        }

        try {
            UserRead user = permit.api.users.sync(
                    new UserCreate(email)
                            .withEmail(email)
                            .withFirstName(firstName)
                            .withLastName(lastName)
            ).getResult();
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(user);
        } catch (IOException | PermitApiError | PermitContextError e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                    .body(Map.of("error", "Failed to sync user"));
        }
    }
    // Create a tenant
    @PostMapping("/create-tenant")
    public ResponseEntity<?> createTenant(@RequestBody Map<String, String> body) {
        String key = body.get("key");
        String name = body.get("name");
        String description = body.get("description");

        if (key == null || name == null) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(Map.of("error", "Missing key or name"));
        }

        try {
            TenantCreate tenantCreate = new TenantCreate(key, name).withDescription(description);
            TenantRead tenant = permit.api.tenants.create(tenantCreate);
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(tenant);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                    .body(Map.of("error", "Failed to create tenant"));
        }
    }
    // Check if the user has access to the resource
    @PostMapping("/check-permission")
    public ResponseEntity<?> checkPermission(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> body) {
        String userKey = (String) body.get("user");
        String action = (String) body.get("action");
        String resource = (String) body.get("resource");

        if (userKey == null || action == null || resource == null) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(Map.of("error", "Missing required fields"));
        }

        try {
            boolean permitted = permit.check(
                    User.fromString(userKey),
                    action,
                    new Resource.Builder(resource).withTenant("default").build()
            );
            if (permitted) {
                return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("message", "User is permitted"));
            } else {
                return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
                        .body(Map.of("message", "User is not permitted"));
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                    .body(Map.of("error", "Permission check failed"));
        }
    }
```

This controller has three endpoints:

- `sync-user`: Syncs a user with Permit.io. It will create a new user if the user does not exist; otherwise, it will update the existing user.
- `create-tenant`: Creates a tenant with Permit.io. It will create a new tenant if the tenant does not exist; otherwise, it will update the existing tenant.
- `check-permission`: Checks if a user has access to a resource. It will return a boolean value: if the user is permitted to access the resource, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the PDP server

Now, our application is ready by syncing the user and having a policy created. Let's enforce and check the policy. To enforce the policy, we use [Permit's PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview) (Policy Decision Point) to check if the user has access to the resource. So first, let's set up the PDP.

By running the following command, Permit CLI will spin up our environment PDP in a docker container.

```bash
permit pdp run
```

Once we execute the above command, you will see an output like the one below, with information such as container ID, name, etc.

![permit pdp run](/img/quick-start-guide/create-pdp.png)

The PDP server will be running on port `7766` by default. We can also change the port. Finally, update the `PDP_URL` environment variable in your application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Syncing the user

Let's run the application and do `curl` requests to test the endpoint for the `/sync-user` endpoint.

![curl create user](/img/quick-start-guide/spring-sync-user.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is created successfully, and we get a lot of information about the user in the response, such as `id`, `project_id`, `key`, etc.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Giving the user access to the resource

Now that we have created a user, let's give this user access to the resource we created in the policy. To do that:
1. Select **Directory** from the left sidebar in Permit's dashboard.
2. Click **Add Role** button.
3. Select tenant **(default)** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Author** role and save it.

We will verify this later when we check the access.

![user access](/img/quick-start-guide/user-access.png)

We can also add more roles and resources as per our needs. Now, let's set up the PDP server and check the access.

:::info
We can give the access programmatically, it was a demo to show how easy it is to add access using the dashboard.
:::

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Checking the access

Now, let's check the policy enforcement. As we have added the user to the **Author** role, we can check if the user has **create** access to the **Post** resource. To do that, we will use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/check-permission` endpoint.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/spring-user-permitted.png)

As we can see in the image above, the user is permitted to access the resource. Let's remove the access from the dashboard and check again.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/spring-user-not-permitted.png)

Now, this time, we can see that the user is not permitted to access the resource. This is how we can enforce policies using Permit.io with Spring Boot.

</TimelineStep>

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have seen how to integrate Permit.io with Spring Boot. We created a policy with a template using the Permit CLI, synced a user, created a tenant, and checked the access using the Permit SDK. We also saw how to set up the PDP server locally using Docker. This is just the beginning, and there are many more features and functionalities that Permit.io offers.
