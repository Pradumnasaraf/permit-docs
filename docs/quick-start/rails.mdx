In this guide, we will quickly go through the steps to integrate Permit.io with Rails. We will use Permit's CLI to create a new environment and a policy with a template. Then, we will use the Permit SDK to integrate it with our Rails application. We will also set up the PDP (Policy Decision Point) server locally using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Rails application
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the PDP server)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for running the Permit CLI)
- [Permit.io](https://permit.io) account (Follow [this](/quickstart) guide to create an account)

<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Permit CLI

We will first install the [Permit CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli). Permit CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create policies, run the PDP server, and perform other tasks. To install the CLI, execute the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @permitio/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, execute `permit` to confirm the installation. 

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Authenticating the CLI

To use the CLI, we need to authenticate it with our Permit account. To authenticate, execute 

```bash
permit login
```

This will open a browser window and ask you to log in with your Permit account. After logging in, the CLI will be authenticated and ready to use. This will also log you into the default environment (a project can have multiple environments). 

We can change the environment by executing `permit env select` and then selecting the environment we want to use.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a policy with a template

Permit CLI offers various templates to create a policy with predefined roles and resources using best practices. This will save us time and effort in creating a policy from scratch.

To check the available templates, execute `permit template list`. Also, you can head over to the [Permit CLI repo](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/tree/main/source/templates) to see the templates and the actual terraform code for each template.

![permit template list](/img/quick-start-guide/permit-template-list.png)

We will be using the **blogging-platform** template to create the policy. This template will help us setting up a policy for a blogging platform with roles and resources. The policy is explained in detail below in the next step.

To apply the template, execute the command below.

```bash
permit template apply --template blogging-platform
```

You will see a successful message in the terminal.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Understanding and accessing the policy from the dashboard

Now, head over to the Permit's dashboard and select the project and click on the **Policy** tab from the left sidebar. You will see the policy we just created.

![permit policy](/img/quick-start-guide/policy-editor-dash.png)

This policy defines access control for a blogging platform, here is breakdown of the policy: 
- **Posts** and **Comments** are the resources.
- Users are assigned roles like **Author**, **Moderator**, or **Reader**, with permissions scoped to each resource.
- A `premium` attribute on posts enables ABAC, restricting access to premium content.
- Through a **Postâ€“Comment** relationship, **Post Authors** automatically become **Comment Moderators**.
- A **Free Post** resource set filters non-premium posts, allowing **Readers** to access only free content.
The setup combines ABAC and ReBAC to enforce flexible and secure permissions.

It's quite easy to add and remove the permissions by checking and unchecking the permissions in the policy editor.

### Getting the API key

To get the API key:

1. Click on **Projects** from the left sidebar.
2. Click on the three dots on the environment we want to use.
3. Click on **Copy API Key** and store it in a safe place. We will be using this API key to authenticate our application with Permit.io. If you are having any difficulty getting the API key, follow this [guide](/overview/connecting-your-app/#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

Once we are done, let's move toward the implementation part and integrate Permit.io with our Rails application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Ruby SDK

Once your Rails application is ready (or you can create a new one for the sake of this guide) we can integrate Permit.io with it. First, install the Permit's Ruby on Rails SDK. 

Read more about the Ruby on Rails SDK [here](/sdk/ruby/quickstart-ruby).

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'permit-sdk'
```

Then run the following command to install the package:

```bash
bundle install
```

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the Rails application with Permit.io

Let's start by creating a Permit helper file. This file will be used to initialize the Permit SDK and export the instance. Create a new file called `permit.rb` in the `config/initializers` directory and add the following code.

```ruby
# config/initializers/permit.rb
require 'permit'

# Optional safety checks
raise "PERMIT_API_KEY is not set" unless ENV['PERMIT_API_KEY']
raise "PDP_URL is not set" unless ENV['PDP_URL']

# Initialize the Permit SDK
PERMIT = Permit.new(
  ENV['PERMIT_API_KEY'],
  ENV['PDP_URL']
)
```

It needs two environment variables `PERMIT_API_KEY` is the API key we copied from the Permit dashboard, and the `PDP_URL` is the URL of the PDP server. We will set this up later.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a controller

Create a new file called `permit_controller.rb` in the `app/controllers` directory and add the following code:

```ruby
# app/controllers/permit_controller.rb
class PermitController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def sync_user
    user = PERMIT.api.users.sync(
      key: params[:email],
      email: params[:email],
      first_name: params[:first_name],
      last_name: params[:last_name]
    )
    render json: user, status: :created
  rescue => e
    render json: { error: e.message }, status: :internal_server_error
  end

  def create_tenant
    tenant = PERMIT.api.tenants.create(
      key: params[:key],
      name: params[:name],
      description: params[:description]
    )
    render json: tenant, status: :created
  rescue => e
    render json: { error: e.message }, status: :internal_server_error
  end

  def check_permission
    permitted = PERMIT.check(
      params[:user],
      params[:action],
      params[:resource]
    )
    if permitted
      render json: { message: "User is permitted" }
    else
      render json: { message: "User is not permitted" }, status: :forbidden
    end
  rescue => e
    render json: { error: e.message }, status: :internal_server_error
  end
end
```

This controller has three endpoints:

- `sync_user`: Syncs a user with Permit.io. It will create a new user if the user does not exist; otherwise, it will update the existing user.
- `create_tenant`: Creates a tenant with Permit.io. It will create a new tenant if the tenant does not exist; otherwise, it will update the existing tenant.
- `check_permission`: Checks if a user has access to a resource. It will return a boolean value: if the user is permitted to access the resource, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Adding routes configuration

Now, add the routes for the above controller. Open the `config/routes.rb` file and add the following code:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  post '/sync-user', to: 'permit#sync_user'
  post '/create-tenant', to: 'permit#create_tenant'
  post '/check-permission', to: 'permit#check_permission'
end
```

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the PDP server

Now, our application is ready by syncing the user and having a policy created. Let's enforce and check the policy. To enforce the policy, we use [Permit's PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview) (Policy Decision Point) to check if the user has access to the resource. So first, let's set up the PDP.

By running the following command, Permit CLI will spin up our environment PDP in a docker container.

```bash
permit pdp run
```

Once we execute the above command, you will see an output like the one below, with information such as container ID, name, etc.

![permit pdp run](/img/quick-start-guide/create-pdp.png)

The PDP server will be running on port `7766` by default. We can also change the port. Finally, update the `PDP_URL` environment variable in your application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Syncing the user

Now that everything is set up, let's run the application and make `curl` requests to test the sync user endpoint.

![curl create user](/img/quick-start-guide/rails-sync-user.png)

As seen in the image above, the user is created successfully, and the response includes details like `id`, `project_id`, `key`, etc.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Giving the user access to the resource

Now that we have created a user, let's give this user access to the resource we created in the policy. To do that:
1. Select **Directory** from the left sidebar in Permit's dashboard.
2. Click **Add Role** button.
3. Select tenant **(default)** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Author** role and save it.

We will verify this later when we check the access.

![user access](/img/quick-start-guide/user-access.png)

We can also add more roles and resources as per our needs. Now, let's set up the PDP server and check the access.

:::info
We can give the access programmatically, it was a demo to show how easy it is to add access using the dashboard.
:::

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Checking the access

Now, let's check the policy enforcement. As we have added the user to the **Author** role, we can check if the user has **create** access to the **Post** resource. To do that, we will use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/check-permission` endpoint.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/rails-user-permitted.png)

As seen in the image above, the user is permitted to access the resource. Let's now remove access via the dashboard and test again.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/rails-user-not-permitted.png)

This time, we can see that the user is not permitted to access the resource. This is how you can enforce policies using Permit.io with Rails.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have learned how to integrate Permit.io with a Rails application. We created a new policy using a template with the Permit CLI, integrated the Permit SDK with our application, set up the PDP server locally using Docker, and verified user access. This guide provides a quick start to using Permit.io with Rails.
